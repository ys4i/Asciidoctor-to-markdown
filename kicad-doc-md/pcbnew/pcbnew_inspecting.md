# Inspecting a board

## Design rules checking

The Design Rules Checker (DRC) tool is used to verify that the PCB meets
all the requirements established in the Board Setup dialog and that all
pads are connected according to the netlist or schematic. KiCad can
automatically prevent some design rule violations while routing tracks,
but many others cannot be prevented automatically. This means it is
important to use the design rule checker before creating manufacturing
files for a PCB.

To use the design rule checker, click the ![erc
24](images/icons/erc_24.png) icon in the top toolbar, or select **Design
Rules Checker** from the **Inspect** menu.

<img src="images/drc_control.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="drc control" />
</figure>

The top section of the DRC Control window contains some options that
control the design rule checker:

**Refill all zones before performing DRC:** when enabled, zones will be
refilled every time the design rule checker is run. Disabling this
option may result in incorrect DRC results if zones have not been
refilled manually.

**Report all errors for each track:** when enabled, all clearance errors
will be reported for each track segment. When disabled, only the first
error will be reported. Enabling this option will result in the design
rule checker running more slowly.

**Test for parity between PCB and schematic:** when enabled, the design
rule checker will test for differences between the schematic and PCB in
addition to testing the PCB design rules. This option has no effect when
running the PCB editor in standalone mode.

After running DRC, any violations will be shown in the center part of
the DRC window. Rule violations, unconnected items, and differences
between the schematic and the PCB are shown in three different tabs. A
list of the ignored tests is shown in the fourth tab. A report file in
plain text format can be created after running DRC using the **Save…​**
button.

<figure>
<img src="images/drc_violations.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="drc violations" />
</figure>

Each violation involves one or more objects on the PCB. In the list of
violations, the objects involved are listed below the violation.
Clicking on the violation in the list view will move the PCB Editor view
so that the affected area is centered. Clicking on one of the objects
involved in a violation will highlight the object.

Certain types of violations have contextual actions in the context menu.
For example, clearance violations have an action to run the [clearance
resolution tool](#clearance-and-constraint-resolution) on the violating
items, while custom rule violations have an action to run the
[constraint resolution tool](#clearance-and-constraint-resolution). For
board vs. library footprint mismatch violations, there is an action to
run the [Compare Footprint with Library](#comparing-footprints) tool.
These actions can help to quickly identify the reason for a particular
violation.

The numbers at the bottom of the window show the number of errors,
warnings, and exclusions. Each type of violation can be filtered from
the list using the respective checkboxes. Clicking **Delete Marker**
will clear the selected violation until DRC is run again, while clicking
**Delete All Markers** will clear all violations until the next DRC run.

Violations can be right-clicked in the dialog to ignore them or change
their severity:

- **Exclude this violation:** ignores this particular violation, but
  does not affect any other violations. You can un-exclude a violation
  by right clicking the excluded violation and selecting **Remove
  exclusion for this violation**.

- **Exclude with comment…​:** the same as **Exclude this violation**, but
  prompts for a comment explaining the reason for the exclusion. When
  excluded violations are unhidden (using the **Exclusions** checkbox),
  exclusion comments are shown with the corresponding excluded
  violation. To edit an existing exclusion comment or add a comment to
  an existing exclusion, right click an excluded violation and select
  **Edit exclusion comment…​**.

- **Exclude all violations of rule:** the same as **Exclude this
  violation**, but excludes *all* violations caused by the same [custom
  DRC rule](#custom-design-rules). This action only appears in the
  context menu for violations caused by custom design rules. If you
  right click on a custom design rule violation that is already
  excluded, you can instead **Remove all exclusions for violations of
  rule**.

- **Change severity:** changes a type of violation from warning to
  error, or error to warning. This affects all violations of a given
  type.

- **Ignore all:** ignores all violations of a given type. This test will
  now appear in the **Ignored Tests** tab rather than the **Violations**
  tab. You can un-ignore the test again by right clicking the test in
  the **Ignored Tests** tab, or in the [Violation Severity
  panel](#board-setup-violation-severity) in Board Setup.

- **Edit violation severities…​:** opens the [Violation Severity
  panel](#board-setup-violation-severity) in Board Setup, for editing
  the severities of all DRC violation types.

Excluded and ignored violations are remembered between runs of the
design rule checker. Excluded violations are hidden unless the
**Exclusions** checkbox is enabled. Ignored violations are not shown,
but there is a list of ignored tests in the **Ignored Tests** tab.

### Clearance and constraint resolution

The clearance and constraint resolution tools allow you to inspect which
clearance and design constraint rules apply to selected items. These
tools can help when designing PCBs with complex design rules where it is
not always clear which rules apply to an object.

To inspect the clearance rules that apply between two objects, select
both objects and choose **Clearance Resolution** from the **Inspect**
menu. The Clearance Report dialog will show the clearance required
between the objects on each copper layer, as well as the design rules
that resulted in that clearance.

<figure>
<img src="images/clearance_resolution.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="clearance resolution" />
</figure>

To inspect the design constraints that apply to an object, select it and
choose **Constraints Resolution** from the **Inspect** menu. The
Constraints Report dialog will show any constraints that apply to the
object.

<figure>
<img src="images/constraints_resolution.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="constraints resolution" />
</figure>

### DRC configuration

The severity of each DRC check can be configured in the **Violation
Severity** section of the [Board Setup
dialog](#board-setup-violation-severity). Each rule may be set to create
an error marker, a warning marker, or no marker (ignored).

<div class="note">

Individual rule violations may be ignored in the Design Rule Checker.
Setting a rule to Ignore in the Violation Severity section will
completely disable the corresponding design rule check. Use this setting
with caution.

</div>

### List of DRC checks

The table below lists the design rules that KiCad checks and the default
violation severity for each check. All severities are configurable. Some
design are only available through [custom design
rules](#custom-design-rules).

#### Electrical DRC checks

These DRC checks look for gross electrical issues on the board such as
shorts and clearance violations.

### User-definable DRC violations

You can manually trigger board DRC warnings or errors using special
[text variables](#text-variables). These items will appear as errors or
warnings when DRC runs. This can be useful to flag items for later
followup or review.

To cause a DRC violation, use the text variable
`${DRC_ERROR <violation name>}` or `${DRC_WARNING <violation name>}`
depending on whether an error or warning is desired. You can place this
in a text item or text box on any board layer. When DRC runs, this will
generate a DRC violation with the given violation name. These text
variables resolve to an empty string in the board, and any text after
the braces is included in the DRC violation’s description. The text
variable must be placed at the start of the text object in order to
trigger a violation.

For example, a text item containing
`${DRC_ERROR TODO}Length match tracks` will appear in the board as just
the text "Length match tracks", and will generate a DRC error named
"TODO" with "Length matches tracks" in the description.

### DRC report file

An DRC report file can be generated and saved by clicking the **Save…​**
button in the DRC dialog. The file extension for DRC report files is
`.rpt`. An example DRC report file is given below.

    ** Drc report for pic_programmer.kicad_pcb **

## Board Statistics

The Board Statistics dialog shows a summary of the board’s contents,
including the size of the board and counts of various types of items.
Open the Board Statistics dialog with **Inspect** → **Show Board
Statistics**.

<figure>
<img src="images/Pcbnew_board_statistics.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Pcbnew board statistics" />
</figure>

The **General** tab gives counts of various types of objects:

- Footprints, separated by type (THT, SMD, or unspecified) and board
  side

- Pads, separated by type (THT, SMD, connector, or NPTH)

- Vias, separated by type (through, blind/buried, or micro)

It also displays the board width, height, and area.

The **Drill Holes** tab lists every unique type of drill hole on the
board. Each type of hole is listed with its characteristics (shape, X
and Y size, plating, pad or via type, and start and stop layers) and the
count of that type of hole.

You can save the board statistics to a file by clicking the **Generate
Report File…​** button.

## Measurement tool

The measurement tool allows you to make distance and angle measurements
between points on the PCB. To activate the tool, click the ![measurement
24](images/icons/measurement_24.png) icon in the right toolbar, or use
the hotkey <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+M</span>. Once the tool is
active, click once to set the measurement start point, then click again
to finish a measurement.

<figure>
<img src="images/measurement_tool.png" alt="measurement tool" />
</figure>

The tool displays the total (radial) distance between the points, the
distance in X and Y directions, and the measured angle from horizontal.
In other words, both the Cartesian and radial (polar) distances are
displayed.

<div class="note">

The measurement tool is used for quick measurements that do not need to
be displayed permanently. Any measurement you make will only be shown
while the tool is active. To create permanent dimensions that will
appear in printouts and plots, use the Dimension tools.

</div>

## Find tool

The Find tool searches for text in the PCB, including reference
designators, footprint fields, and graphic text. When the tool finds a
match, the canvas is zoomed and centered on the match and the text is
highlighted. Launch the tool using the (![Find
icon](images/icons/find_24.png)) button in the top toolbar.

<figure>
<img src="images/find_dialog.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="Find dialog" />
</figure>

The Find tool has several options:

**Match case:** Selects whether the search is case-sensitive.

**Whole words only:** When selected, the search will only match the
search term with complete words in the PCB. When unselected, the search
will match if the search term is part of a larger word in the PCB.

**Wildcards:** When selected, wildcards can be used in the search terms.
`?` matches any single character, and `*` matches any number of
characters. Note that when this option is selected, partial matches are
not returned: searching for `abc*` will match the string `abcd`, but
searching for `abc` will not.

**Wrap:** When selected, search results will return to the first hit
after reaching the last hit.

**Search footprint reference designators:** Selects whether the search
should apply to footprint reference designators.

**Search footprint values:** Selects whether the search should apply to
footprint value fields.

**Search other text items:** Selects whether the search should apply to
other text items, including graphical text and footprint fields other
than value and reference.

**Search DRC markers:** Selects whether the search should apply to the
violation descriptions of DRC markers shown on the board.

**Search net names:** Selects whether the search should apply to the
names of nets in the board.

## Search panel

The search panel is a docked panel that lists information about
footprints, zones, nets, ratsnest lines (unrouted segments), and text
from the PCB. Show or hide the search panel with **View** → **Panels** →
**Search** or use the <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+G</span> shortcut.

<figure>
<img src="images/search_panel.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Search panel, with a footprint selected" />
</figure>

You can optionally filter the list based on a search string. When no
filter is used, all items in the design are listed in the corresponding
tab. Items are filtered based on their properties:

- Footprints are filtered by the contents of their fields. You can
  select whether to search hidden fields by enabling the **Search Hidden
  Fields** option in the ![config 16](images/icons/config_16.png) menu.
  Footprints are also filtered by their metadata (library link,
  description, and keywords) if **Search Metadata** is enabled in the
  ![config 16](images/icons/config_16.png) menu.

- Zones are filtered by the zone name.

- Net and ratsnest items are filtered by the net name.

- Text (text, textboxes, and dimensions) is filtered by the text
  content.

You can sort the filtered results in ascending or descending order of
the value in a particular column by clicking on that column header.

Filters support wildcards: `*` matches any characters, and `?` matches
any single character. You can also use [regular
expressions](http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_resyntax.html), such
as `/footprint value/`.

The displayed information depends on the item type:

- All items list their name and/or value.

- Physical items (footprints, zones, and text) additionally list their
  layer and X/Y location.

- Footprints additionally list their library link (library name and
  footprint name) and description.

- Text additionally lists the type of text object (text, textbox, or
  dimension).

- Net and ratsnest items additionally list their net name and net class.

When you click an item in the search panel, the item is selected in the
editing canvas. Depending on what is configured in the ![config
16](images/icons/config_16.png) menu, the board editor will also pan
and/or zoom to the selected item in the editing canvas. Double-clicking
an item in the search panel opens its properties dialog (for net and
ratsnest items, the [net classes dialog](#board-setup-net-classes) is
opened instead).

## 3D Viewer

The 3D Viewer shows a 3-dimensional view of the board and the components
on the board. You can view the board from different perspectives, show
or hide different types of components, cross-probe from the PCB Editor
to the 3D viewer, and generate raytraced renders of the board. Show the
3D Viewer with **View** → **3D Viewer** or use the
<span class="keycombo">Alt+3</span> shortcut.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/3d_viewer.png" alt="3D viewer" />
</figure>

<div class="note">

The 3D model for a component will only appear if the 3D model file
exists and has been [assigned to the
footprint](#working-with-footprints).

</div>

<div class="note">

Many footprints in KiCad’s standard library do not yet have model files
created for them. However, these footprints may contain a path to a 3D
model that does not yet exist, in anticipation of the 3D model being
created in the future.

</div>

### Navigating the 3D view

Dragging with the left mouse button will orbit the 3D view. By default
this is the centroid of the board, but the pivot point can be reset to a
new point on the board by moving the cursor over the desired point and
pressing Space. Scrolling the mouse wheel will zoom the view in or out.
Scrolling while holding Ctrl pans the view left and right, and scrolling
while holding Shift pans up and down. Dragging with the middle mouse
button also pans the view.

Different sized 3D grids can be set using the **View** → **3D Grid**
menu. Bounding boxes for each component can be enabled with
**Preferences** → **Show Model Bounding Boxes**.

When the PCB Editor and the 3D Viewer are both open, selecting a
footprint in the PCB Editor will also highlight the component in the 3D
Viewer. The highlight color is adjustable in **Preferences** →
**Preferences…​** → **3D Viewer** → **Realtime Renderer** → **Selection
Color**.

### Appearance Manager

The Appearance Manager is a panel at the right of the viewer which
provides controls to manage the visibility, color, and opacity of
different types of objects and board layers in the 3D view.

Each layer or type of object in the list can be individually shown or
hidden by clicking its corresponding visibility icon. PCB layers can
have their colors customized; double-click on the color swatch next to
the item type to edit the item’s color and opacity. To use the colors
selected in the Board Setup dialog’s Physical Stackup editor, enable the
**use board stackup colors** option. If you enable the **use PCB editor
copper colors** option, copper layers in the 3D viewer will use the
colors configured in the PCB editor canvas.

You can save an appearance configuration as a preset, or load a
configuration from a preset, using the **Preset** selector at the
bottom. The <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Tab</span> hotkey cycles through
presets; press Tab repeatedly while holding Ctrl to cycle through
multiple presets. Several built-in presets are available: "Follow PCB
Editor" matches the visibility settings in the PCB editor, "Follow PCB
Plot Settings" matches the visibility settings selected in the Plot
dialog, and "legacy colors" matches the default 3D Viewer color settings
from older versions of KiCad.

Finally, you can save a viewport for later retrieval using the
**Viewports** selector at the bottom. You can quickly cycle between
saved viewports using <span class="keycombo">Shift+Tab</span>; pressing
Tab repeatedly while holding Shift will cycle through multiple
viewports.

### Generating images with the 3D Viewer

The current 3D view can be saved to an image with **File** → **Export
Current View as PNG…​** or **Export Current View as JPG…​**, depending on
the desired image format. The current view can also be copied to the
clipboard using the ![copy icon](images/icons/copy_24.png) button, or
**Edit** → **Copy 3D Image**.

The 3D Viewer has a raytracing rendering mode which displays the board
using a more physically accurate rendering model than the default
rendering mode. Raytracing is slower than the default rendering mode,
but it can be used when the most visually attractive results are
desired. Raytracing mode is enabled with the ![raytracing
icon](images/icons/render_mode_24.png) button, or with **Preferences** →
**Raytracing**. The 3D grid and selection highlights are not shown in
raytracing mode.

Colors and other rendering options, for both raytraced and non-raytraced
modes, can be adjusted in **Preferences** → **Preferences…​** → **3D
Viewer**.

### 3D viewer controls

Many viewing options are controlled with the top toolbar.

## Net inspector

The Net Inspector is a docked panel that allows you to view statistics
about all the nets in a board. It also lets you add, remove, and rename
nets. To open the inspector, click the ![list nets
24](images/icons/list_nets_24.png) icon at the top of the Nets section
of the Appearance panel, or select **View** → **Panels** → **Net
Inspector**.

alt="net inspector" />
</figure>

Double-clicking a net in the list will [highlight](#net-highlighting)
that net on the board. You can also highlight a net by right clicking it
and selecting **Highlight Selected Net**. If multiple nets are selected,
this lets you highlight all of them at once. You can remove the net
highlighting by right clicking the net’s row in the Net Inspector and
selecting **Clear Net Highlighting**, in addition to the usual ways of
[removing net highlighting](#net-highlighting).

Clicking a column title allows you to sort the list of nets by that
column. The Filter box lets you limit the listed nets to those that
match the filter string. By default, the filter matches against both net
names and net class names, but you can filter by just one or the other
by selecting or deselecting **Filter by Net Name** or **Filter by
Netclass** under the ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) menu.

By default, nets with no connections and nets with no pads are not
shown. You can choose to show them by selecting **Show Unconnected
Nets** and **Show Zero Pad Nets** under the ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) menu.

The Net Inspector shows the following statistics for each net:

- **Pad Count** is the number of pads with that net, counting both
  surface mount and through hole pads.

- **Via Count** is the number of vias with that net.

- **Via Length** is the sum total length of all vias with that net. The
  full height of each via is always counted, even if the connections to
  the via are such that the full via height is not electrically used. In
  other words, Via Length is equal to Via Count multiplied by the
  stackup height of the board.

- **Track Length** is the total length of all track segments in a net,
  not accounting for topology. For example, in a branching net structure
  all branches are included in the total length. The track length is
  also reported per copper layer.

- **Die Length** is the total of all Pad to Die Length values set for
  pads on the net.

Each column can be shown or hidden in the ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Show / Hide Columns**
menu. You can save the Net Inspector statistics to a CSV file by
clicking ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Save Net Inspector
Report**. The generated report includes all nets and columns, even if
they are currently filtered or hidden in the Net Inspector.

### Grouping nets

You can group nets in the Net Inspector to organize them and view them
more easily. Each group displays the total statistics for all its
members, as if the group were a single net. For example, if you have a
signal with a series resistor breaking the signal into two nets, you
could create a group that contains both of these nets. This would allow
you to analyze the total length of both nets, rather than each
individually.

You can group nets by their net class by clicking ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Group by netclass**.
Alternatively, you can create custom groups based on net name patterns.
To create a new custom group, click ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Add Custom Group**. Any
nets that contain the specified pattern in their name will be shown as
part of the group and not shown outside of the group. For example, the
pattern `CAN` matches the nets `CAN_RX` and `CAN_TX`. Patterns are not
case sensitive.

The pattern can also use regular expressions to match nets if the
pattern is surrounded in slashes. For example, the pattern `/^AN/`
matches nets `AN0`, `AN1`, etc., but not `CAN`.

To remove a group and release its members back into the full list of
nets, click ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Remove Selected Custom
Group**. This action is also available in the right click menu. To
remove all groups at once, click ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Remove All Custom
Groups**.

### Editing nets

The Net Inspector allows you to create new nets in the board and remove
or rename existing nets. To create a new net, right click in the Net
Inspector and select **Add Net**, then provide a name for the new net.
To delete a net, right click it in the list of nets and choose **Delete
Selected Net**. If multiple nets are selected, they will all be deleted.
To rename a net, right click it and choose **Rename Selected Net**, then
provide a new name.

<div class="note">

Nets are usually not edited in the board. Instead, it is recommended to
define nets in the schematic. Nets are typically managed in the board by
creating or modifying a schematic and then using the [Update PCB From
Schematic](#forward-annotation) tool to update the nets in the board
based on the schematic design. The Net Inspector can be used to manage
nets in alternate workflows that do not use a schematic.

</div>

<div class="note">

Nets that are modified in the Board Editor will not effect the schematic
until the [schematic is updated from the PCB](#back-annotation) through
the back-annotation process.

### Differences between Net Inspector and Length Tuner

The Net Inspector may report different net lengths than the [length
tuner](#length-tuning), because the two tools have different purposes
and calculate track/net lengths differently. In short, the Net Inspector
sums up the total length of each track segment and via on a net, while
the length tuner calculates the effective electrical length of a path
between two points on a net. The specific differences are as follows:

- The Net Inspector reports track length as a simple sum of the length
  of each track segment on a net. The length tuner calculates an
  effective electrical length of a net, which includes optimizing paths
  through pads to calculate the shortest possible path.

- If a routed net has a branching topology, the Net Inspector total
  includes the length of each branch in the total. The length tuner
  calculates a point-to-point length; if there are any branches, the
  length tuner will stop at the closest branch and report the length up
  to the branch.

- The Net Inspector always includes the effective via height in its via
  length and total length calculations. If a via connects to tracks on
  both the top and bottom layers, the full via height is included in the
  length calculation. Otherwise, only the stackup height between the
  connected layers is included. The length tuner calculates effective
  via height in the same way as the Net Inspector, but via height is
  only included in the length calculation when the **use stackup
  height** setting is enabled [board constraint
  settings](#board-setup-constraints). If the setting is disabled, the
  length tuner will not include vias in its calculations at all.
