# Generating Outputs

## Printing

KiCad can print the schematic to a standard printer using
**File**→**Print…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_print.png" alt="Print dialog" />
</figure>

### Printing options

- **Print drawing sheet:** Include the drawing sheet border and title
  block in the printed schematic.

- **Output mode:** Print the schematic in color or black and white.

- **Print background color:** Include the background color in the
  printed schematic. This option is only enabled when printing in color.

- **Use a different color theme for printing:** Select a different color
  scheme for printing than the one selected for display in the Schematic
  Editor.

- **Page Setup…​:** Opens a page setup dialog for setting paper size and
  orientation.

- **Close:** Closes the dialog without printing.

- **Print:** Opens the system print dialog.

<div class="note">

Printing uses platform- and printer-specific drivers and may have
unexpected results. When printing to a file, **Plotting** is recommended
instead of **Printing**.

</div>

## Plotting

KiCad can plot schematics to a file using **File** → **Plot…​**.

The supported output formats are Postscript, PDF, SVG, and DXF.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_plot.png" alt="Plot dialog" />
</figure>

The **Output Messages** pane displays messages about the generated
files. Different kinds of messages can be shown or hidden using the
checkboxes, and the messages can be saved to a file using the **Save…​**
button.

The **Plot Current Page** button plots the current page of the
schematic. The **Plot All Pages** button plots all pages of the
schematic. One file is generated for each page, except for PDF output,
which plots each schematic page as a separate page in a single PDF file.

### Plotting options

- **Output directory:** Specify the location to save plotted files. If
  this is a relative path, it is created relative to the project
  directory. This path can use [text variables](#text-variables),
  including both project text variables and built-in text variables.

- **Output Format:** Select the format to plot in. Some formats have
  different options than others.

- **Page size:** Sets the page size to use for the plotted output. This
  can be set to match the schematic size or to another sheet size.

- **Plot drawing sheet:** Include the drawing sheet border and title
  block in the printed schematic.

- **Output mode:** Sets the output to color or black and white. Not all
  output formats support color.

- **Color theme:** Selects the color theme to use for the plotted
  output.

- **Plot background color:** Includes the schematic background color in
  the plotted output. The background color will not be plotted if the
  output format does not support color or the output mode is black and
  white.

- **Minimum line width:** Selects the minimum width for lines. Any lines
  narrower than this width will be plotted with this minimum width.

- **Generate property popups:** Enables the interactive PDF features
  described below. This option only applies for PDF output.

- **Generate clickable links for hierarchical elements:** Enables
  clickable hierarchical sheets, hierarchical sheet pins, and
  hierarchical labels. When enabled, clicking a hierarchical sheet or
  sheet pin in the PDF will open the PDF page for that subsheet.
  Clicking a hierarchical label will open the page for the parent sheet.
  If **Generate property popups** is also enabled, links will be
  generated instead of property popups for hierarchical sheets, pins,
  and labels (i.e. this option takes priority). This option only applies
  for PDF output.

- **Generate metadata from AUTHOR and SUBJECT variables:** Sets the
  Author and Subject PDF document properties for the generated PDF based
  on the `AUTHOR` and `SUBJECT` [project text
  variables](#schematic-setup-text-variables), if you have defined them.
  This option only applies for PDF output.

- **Open file after plot:** automatically opens the plotted output file
  when plotting is complete.

### Interactive PDF features

Plotted PDFs can optionally have several interactive features.

<figure>
<img src="images/pdf_interactive_symbol_details.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="symbol fields popup" />
</figure>

- Hyperlinks can be clicked.

- The table of contents is populated with schematic sheets as well as
  the symbols and hierarchical labels in each sheet.

- Clicking on many schematic elements displays a popup menu containing
  relevant information.

  - Symbols display their symbol fields.

  - Hierarchical subsheets display their sheetname and filename, as well
    as an option to enter the sheet itself. This is replaced by a direct
    link to the subsheet if the **Generate clickable links for
    hierarchical elements** option is enabled.

  - Labels display the resolved net and netclass.

  - Buses display their members.

<div class="note">

Some of these features are not supported in all PDF readers. The
clickable links generated by the **Generate clickable links for
hierarchical elements** option are more widely supported than other
interactive features.

</div>

## Generating a bill of materials

KiCad can generate a bill of materials that lists all of the components
in the design. BOMs are configurable: you can select which components
are included, how components are ordered, which symbol fields are
included and in what order, and what the output format is.

BOMs are exported using the [Symbol Fields Table](#symbol-fields-table).
As a shortcut to open the **Export** tab of this dialog, you can select
**Tools** → **Generate Bill of Materials…​** or use the ![BOM
icon](images/icons/post_bom_24.png) button on the top toolbar.

The contents of the BOM are configured in the **Edit** tab. The format
of the exported BOM file is configured in the **Export** tab. The BOM is
written when you press the **Export** button at the bottom of the
dialog.

### BOM contents

The exported BOM will contain exactly the components (rows) and fields
(columns) shown in the **Edit** tab, with the same grouping and sorting.
Components with the **Exclude from BOM** attribute set are hidden in the
**Edit** tab and not included in the BOM export unless the **Show
'Exclude from BOM'** box is checked. Components with the DNP (do not
populate) attribute set can be optionally excluded from both the table
in the **Edit** tab and the exported BOM by checking the **Exclude DNP**
box. You can also limit the displayed components to those in the current
sheet, the current sheet and all of its subsheets, or the entire
schematic by adjusting the **Scope** settings.

<figure>
<img src="images/symbol_fields_table_edit.png"
alt="Symbol Fields Table Edit tab" />
</figure>

Fields with the **Show** box checked will be included as columns in the
BOM, and fields with the **Group By** box checked are used to group
components together. Components are grouped into the same line if all of
their **Group By** fields are identical and the **Group symbols** box is
checked. You can set an arbitrary column name for each field and reorder
columns by dragging their headers.

Presets are available to configure the list of fields. Presets store
which fields are displayed, which fields are used for grouping, and the
column order. You can create and save your own presets or use one of
several default presets. Custom presets can be deleted in this dialog or
in the [Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup) dialog.

The built-in presets "Grouped By Value" and "Grouped By Value and
Footprint" replicate [legacy BOM scripts](#legacy-bom-export), while
"Attributes" shows only the reference and value fields and the DNP,
exclude from board, exclude from simulation, and exclude from BOM
attributes.

Some virtual fields are available that may be useful in BOM exports.
Adding a field in the Symbol Fields Table beginning with a [text
variable](#text-variables) will not create a new field in the symbols,
but will create a special column in the table and BOM with
auto-generated values for each component. The following variables may be
especially useful for creating virtual fields in custom BOM formats:

- `${QUANTITY}` creates a field that contains the number of grouped
  instances of that component.

- `${ITEM_NUMBER}` creates a field that contains the row number of the
  component in the BOM.

- `${SYMBOL_NAME}` creates a field that contains the name of the
  schematic symbol.

- `${SYMBOL_LIBRARY}` creates a field that contains the name of the
  schematic symbol library.

- `${DNP}` creates a field with a checkbox that controls the component’s
  DNP attribute. In the BOM, this field resolves to the string "DNP" if
  the component’s DNP attribute is set, or an empty string otherwise.

- `${EXCLUDE_FROM_BOARD}` creates a field with a checkbox that controls
  the component’s exclude from board attribute. In the BOM, this field
  resolves to the string "Excluded from board" if the component’s
  exclude from board attribute is set, or an empty string otherwise.

- `${EXCLUDE_FROM_SIM}` creates a field with a checkbox that controls
  the component’s exclude from simulation attribute. In the BOM, this
  field resolves to the string "Excluded from simulation" if the
  component’s exclude from simulation attribute is set, or an empty
  string otherwise.

- `${EXCLUDE_FROM_BOM}` creates a field with a checkbox that controls
  the component’s exclude from BOM attribute. Components with the
  exclude from BOM attribute set are not included in the BOM.

Other text variables are also available.

The full functionality of the **Edit** tab, including virtual field
behavior, is explained in more detail in the [Symbol Fields Table
documentation](#symbol-fields-table).

### BOM format

The **Export** tab contains settings concerning the output file format
for the BOM and displays a preview of the raw BOM file output.

<figure>
<img src="images/symbol_fields_table_export.png"
alt="Symbol Fields Table Export tab" />
</figure>

At the top you can specify the output file. Pressing the **Export**
button will write the BOM to this file path. This path can contain [text
variables](#text-variables).

The settings on the left control how the BOM information is formatted in
the file. You can change the delimiter between fields, the delimiter
that surrounds each field, the delimiter that separates a sequence of
references (e.g. the comma in `R1,R3`), and the delimiter for a range of
references (e.g. the dash in `R1-R3`). If no range delimiter is given,
ranges will not be used: `R1-R3` will be written out as `R1,R2,R3`, for
example, assuming `,` as a reference delimiter. Tabs and newlines in
fields can be preserved or stripped, depending on the **Keep tabs** and
**Keep line breaks** settings.

Several default format presets are available. You can select a
comma-separated value (CSV) format, a tab-separated value (TSV) format,
or a semicolon-separated format. You can also create and save your own
presets. Custom presets can be deleted in this dialog or in the
[Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup) dialog.

### Legacy BOM generation

Previous versions of KiCad used external scripts to process the design
information into the desired output format. This BOM generation tool is
still available by selecting **Tools** → **Generate Legacy Bill of
Materials…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/dialog_bom.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="BOM dialog" />
</figure>

Several BOM generator scripts are included with KiCad, and users can
also create their own. BOM generator scripts generally use Python or
XSLT, but other tools can be used as long as you can specify a [command
line](#generator-command-line-format) for KiCad to execute when running
the generator.

You can select which BOM generator to use in the **BOM generator
scripts** list. The rest of the dialog displays information about the
selected generator. You can change the displayed name of the generator
with the **Generator nickname** textbox.

The pane at right displays information about the selected script. When
the generator is executed, the right pane instead displays output from
the script.

The text box at the bottom contains the command that KiCad will use to
execute the generator. It is automatically populated when a script is
selected, but the command may need to be hand-edited for some
generators. KiCad saves the command line for each generator when the BOM
tool is closed, so command line customizations are preserved. For more
details about the command line, see the [advanced
documentation](#generator-command-line-format).

On Windows, the BOM Generator dialog has an additional option **Show
console window**. When this option is unchecked, BOM generators run in a
hidden console window and any output is redirected and printed in the
dialog. When this option is checked, BOM generators run in a visible
console window, which may be necessary if the generator plugin provides
a graphical user interface.

#### BOM generator scripts

By default, the legacy BOM tool presents three output script options.

- `bom_csv_grouped_extra` outputs a CSV with a single section containing
  every component in the design. Components are grouped by value,
  footprint, DNP (do not populate), and any additional fields that are
  specified on the command line. To specify extra fields, add the
  desired field names as quoted strings at the end of the command line.
  For example, to include the `MPN` field, the end of the command line
  would be:
  `<path to script>/bom_csv_grouped_extra.py "%I" "%O.csv" "MPN"`. The
  columns in the BOM are:

  - Line item number

  - Reference designator(s)

  - Quantity

  - Value

  - Footprint

  - DNP

  - Specified extra fields

- `bom_csv_grouped_by_value` outputs a CSV with two sections. The first
  section contains every component in the design, with a single
  component on each line. The second section also contains every
  component, but components are grouped by symbol name, value,
  footprint, and DNP (do not populate). The columns in the BOM are:

  - Line item number

  - Quantity

  - Reference designator(s)

  - Value

  - Symbol library and symbol name

  - Footprint

  - Datasheet

  - DNP

  - Any other symbol fields

- `bom_csv_grouped_by_value_with_fp` outputs a CSV with a single section
  containing every component in the design. Components are grouped by
  value, footprint, and DNP (do not populate). The columns in the BOM
  are:

  - Reference designator(s)

  - Quantity

  - Value

  - Symbol name

  - Footprint

  - Symbol description

  - Vendor

  - DNP

Additional generator scripts are installed with KiCad but are not
populated in the generator script list by default. The location of these
scripts depends on the operating system and may vary based on
installation location.

| Operating System | Location                                                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows          | `C:\Program Files\KiCad\9.0\bin\scripting\plugins\`             |
| Linux            | `/usr/share/kicad/plugins/`                                     |
| macOS            | `/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/SharedSupport/plugins/` |

Additional scripts can be added to the list of BOM generator scripts by
clicking the ![Plus icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) button.
Scripts can be removed by clicking the ![Delete
icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button. The ![Edit
icon](images/icons/small_edit_16.png) button opens the selected script
in a text editor.

For more information on creating and using custom BOM generators, see
the [advanced documentation](#custom-netlist-and-bom-formats).

### BOM export from PCB editor

The PCB Editor can export a BOM through **File** → **Fabrication
Outputs** → **BOM…​**. This method provides no control over the output
format and does not include all symbol information, but is useful for
PCB-only workflows that do not involve a schematic. In general, it is
recommended to use the schematic editor’s BOM export tool instead.

## Generating a Netlist

A netlist is a file which describes electrical connections between
symbol pins. These connections are referred to as nets. Netlist files
contain:

- A list of symbols and their pins.

- A list of connections (nets) between symbol pins.

Many different netlist formats exist. Sometimes the symbols list and the
list of nets are two separate files. This netlist is fundamental in the
use of schematic capture software, because the netlist is the link with
other electronic CAD software, such as PCB layout software, simulators,
and programmable logic compilers.

KiCad supports several netlist formats:

- KiCad format, which can be imported by the KiCad PCB Editor. However,
  the ["Update PCB from
  Schematic"](eeschema_schematic_to_pcb.xml#schematic-to-pcb) tool
  should be used instead of importing a KiCad netlist into the PCB
  editor.

- OrCAD PCB2 format, for designing PCBs with OrCAD.

- Allegro format, for designing PCBs with Allegro.

- PADS format, for designing PCBs with PADS.

- CADSTAR format, for designing PCBs with CADSTAR.

- Spice format, for use with various external circuit simulators.

<div class="note">

In KiCad version 5.0 and later, it is not necessary to create a netlist
for transferring a design from the schematic editor to the PCB editor.
Instead, use the ["Update PCB from
Schematic"](eeschema_schematic_to_pcb.xml#schematic-to-pcb) tool.

</div>

<div class="note">

Other software tools that use netlists may have restrictions on spaces
and special characters in component names, pins, nets, and other fields.
For compatibility, be aware of such restrictions in other tools you plan
to use, and name components, nets, etc. accordingly.

</div>

### Netlist formats

Netlists are exported with the Export Netlist dialog
(**File**→**Export**→**Netlist…​**).

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_netlist_dialog_kicad.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="KiCad netlist export" />
</figure>

KiCad supports exporting netlists in several formats: KiCad, OrcadPCB2,
Allegro, PADS, CADSTAR, Spice, and Spice Model. Each format can be
selected by selecting the corresponding tab at the top of the window.
Some netlist formats have additional options.

Clicking the **Export Netlist** button prompts for a netlist filename
and saves the netlist.

<div class="note">

Netlist generation can take up to several minutes for large schematics.

</div>

Custom generators for other netlist formats can be added by clicking the
**Add Generator…​** button. Custom generators are external tools that are
called by KiCad, for example Python scripts or XSLT stylesheets. For
more information on custom netlist generators, see [the section on
adding custom netlist generators](#custom-netlist-and-bom-formats).

#### Spice Netlist Format

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_netlist_dialog_spice.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Spice netlist export" />
</figure>

The Spice netlist format offers several options.

- When the **use current sheet as root** is selected, only the current
  sheet is exported to a subcircuit model. Otherwise, the entire
  schematic sheet is exported.

- The **Save all voltages** option adds a `.save all` command to the
  netlist, which causes the simulator to save all node voltages.

- The **Save all currents** option adds a `.probe alli` command to the
  netlist, which causes the simulator save all node currents.

- The **Save all power dissipations** adds `.probe` commands to save the
  power dissipation in each component.

- The **Save all digital event data** removes the `esave none` command
  from the netlist, which causes digital event data to be saved. Digital
  event data may consume a lot of memory.

<div class="note">

Exact behavior may vary between simulation tools.

</div>

Passive symbol values are automatically adjusted to be compatible with
various Spice simulators. Specifically:

- `μ` and `M` as unit prefixes are replaced with `u` and `Meg`,
  respectively

- Units are removed (e.g. `4.7kΩ` is changed to `4.7k`)

- Values in RKM format are rewritten to be Spice-compatible (e.g. `4u7`
  is changed to `4.7u`)

The Spice netlist exporter also provides an easy way to simulate the
generated netlist with an external simulator. This can be useful for
running a simulation without using [KiCad’s internal ngspice
simulator](#simulator), or for running an ngspice simulation with
options that are not supported by KiCad’s simulator tool.

Enter the path to the external simulator in the text box, with `%I`
representing the generated netlist. Check the **run external simulator
command** box to generate the netlist and automatically run the
simulator.

<div class="note">

The default simulator command (`spice "%I"`) must be adjusted to point
to a simulator installed on your system.

</div>

Spice simulators expect simulation commands (`.PROBE`, `.AC`, `.TRAN`,
etc.) to be included in the netlist. Any text line included in the
schematic diagram starting with a period (`.`) will be included in the
netlist. If a text object contains multiple lines, only the lines
beginning with a period will be included.

`.include` directives for including model library files are
automatically added to the netlist based on the Spice model settings for
the symbols in the schematic.

#### Spice Model Netlist Format

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_netlist_dialog_spice_model.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="Spice netlist export" />
</figure>

KiCad can also export a netlist of the schematic as a Spice subcircuit
model, which can be included in a separate Spice simulation. Any
hierarchical labels in the schematic are used as pins for the subcircuit
model. Each pin in the model is annotated with a comment describing the
pin’s electrical direction:

- `Input` hierarchical labels are mapped to an `input` annotation

- `Output` hierarchical labels are mapped to an `output` annotation

- `Bidirectional` hierarchical labels are mapped to an `inout`
  annotation

- `Tri-state` hierarchical labels are mapped to a `tristate` annotation

- `Passive` hierarchical labels are mapped to a `passive` annotation

When the **use current sheet as root** is selected, only the current
sheet is exported to a subcircuit model. Otherwise, the entire schematic
sheet is exported.

### Netlist examples

Below is the schematic from the `sallen_key` project included in KiCad’s
simulation demos.
