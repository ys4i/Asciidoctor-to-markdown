# Introduction to the KiCad PCB Editor

The KiCad PCB Editor is a PCB layout application distributed as a part
of KiCad and available for the following operating systems:

- Linux

- Apple macOS

- Windows

Regardless of the OS, all KiCad files are 100% compatible from one OS to
another.

The PCB Editor is an integrated application where all functions of
placing footprints, routing tracks, library management, and data
transfer to and from the schematic capture software are carried out
within the editor itself.

The KiCad PCB Editor is intended to communicate directly with the KiCad
Schematic Editor for designing printed circuit boards from schematics
without using any intermediate files. It can also import netlist files,
which list all the electrical connections, from other packages.

The PCB Editor includes a footprint library editor, which can create and
edit footprints and manage libraries. It also integrates the following
additional but essential functions needed for modern PCB design
software:

- Design rules check (DRC) for automatic detection of design rule
  violations such as incorrect and missing connections, copper clearance
  and minimum width violations, and many other design issues

- Scriptable design rules for specifying rules with complex constraints
  and conditions

- An interactive router with multiple modes of operation
  (push-and-shove, walkaround, highlight collisions) and support for
  differential pair routing as well as length and skew tuning

- Export of fabrication and plot files in many formats (Gerber,
  IPC-2581, ODB++, GenCAD, PDF, PostScript, and SVG)

- A 3D viewer and 3D model generation in many formats (STEP, GLB, BREP,
  XAO, PLY, STL, IDF, and VRML)

## Initial configuration

When the PCB Editor is run for the first time, if the global footprint
table file `fp-lib-table` is not found in the KiCad configuration folder
then the KiCad will ask how to create this file:

<figure>
<img src="images/en/fp_lib_table_initial_setup.png"
alt="footprint library table initial setup dialog" />
</figure>

The first option is recommended (**Copy default global footprint library
table (recommended)**). The default footprint library table includes all
of the standard footprint libraries that are installed as part of KiCad.

If this option is disabled, KiCad was unable to find the default global
footprint library table. This probably means you did not install the
standard footprint libraries with KiCad, or they are not installed where
KiCad expects to find them. On some systems the KiCad libraries are
installed as a separate package.

- If you have installed the standard KiCad footprint libraries and want
  to use them, but the first option is disabled, select the second
  option and browse to the `fp-lib-table` file in the directory where
  the KiCad libraries were installed.

- If you already have a custom footprint library table that you would
  like to use, select the second option and browse to your
  `fp-lib-table` file.

- If you want to construct a new footprint library table from scratch,
  select the third option.

Footprint library management, including how to re-run this initial
configuration, is described in more detail
[later](#managing-footprint-libraries).

## The PCB Editor user interface

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_user_interface.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="pcbnew user interface" />
</figure>

The main PCB Editor user interface is shown above, with some key
elements indicated:

1.  Top toolbars (file management, zoom tools, editing tools)

2.  Left toolbar (display options)

3.  Message panel and status bar

4.  Right toolbar (drawing and design tools)

5.  Appearance panel

6.  Selection filter panel

## Navigating the editing canvas

The editing canvas is a view onto the board being designed. You can pan
and zoom to different areas of the board, and also flip the view to show
the board from the bottom.

By default, dragging with the middle or right mouse button will pan the
canvas view and scrolling the mouse wheel will zoom the view in or out.
You can change this behavior in the Mouse and Touchpad section of the
preferences (see [Configuration and
Customization](#configuration-and-customization) for details).

Several other zoom tools are available in the top toolbar:

- ![Zoom In icon](images/icons/zoom_in_24.png) zooms in on the center of
  the viewport.

- ![Zoom Out icon](images/icons/zoom_out_24.png) zooms out from the
  center of the viewport.

- ![Zoom to Page icon](images/icons/zoom_fit_in_page_24.png) zooms to
  fit the frame around the drawing sheet.

- ![Zoom to Objects icon](images/icons/zoom_fit_to_objects_24.png) zooms
  to fit the items within the drawing sheet.

- ![Zoom to Selection icon](images/icons/zoom_area_24.png) allows you to
  draw a box to determine the zoomed area.

The cursor’s current position is displayed at the bottom of the window
(X and Y), along with the current zoom factor (Z), the cursor’s relative
position (dx, dy, and dist), the grid setting, and the display units.

The relative coordinates can be reset to zero by pressing Space. This is
useful for measuring distance between two points or aligning objects.

## Hotkeys

The <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+F1</span> shortcut displays the current
hotkey list. The default hotkey list is included in the [Actions
Reference](#pcbnew-actions-reference) section of the manual.

The hotkeys described in this manual use the key labels that appear on a
standard PC keyboard. On an Apple keyboard layout, use the Cmd key in
place of Ctrl, and the Option key in place of Alt.

Many actions do not have hotkeys assigned by default, but hotkeys can be
assigned or redefined using the hotkey editor (**Preferences** →
**Preferences…​** → **[Hotkeys](#preferences-controls)**).

<div class="note">

Many of the actions available through hotkeys are also available in
context menus. To access the context menu, right-click in the editing
canvas. Different actions will be available depending on what is
selected or what tool is active.

</div>

Hotkeys are stored in the file `user.hotkeys` in KiCad’s configuration
directory. The location is platform-specific:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\kicad\9.0\user.hotkeys`

- Linux: `~/.config/kicad/9.0/user.hotkeys`

- macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/kicad/9.0/user.hotkeys`

KiCad can import hotkey settings from a `user.hotkeys` file using the
**Import Hotkeys** button in the hotkey editor.

# Display and selection controls

## Board layers

Layers in the PCB Editor represent physical copper layers on a board, as
well as graphical layers used for defining things such as silkscreen,
solder mask, and the board edge. There is always one layer that is
active in the editor. The active layer is drawn on top of other layers
and will be the layer assigned to newly-created objects. The active
layer is indicated in the layer selector drop-down box in the top
toolbar and is also highlighted in the appearance panel. To change the
active layer, you can left-click a layer name in the appearance panel,
use the drop-down layer selector in the top toolbar, or use a hotkey.
Layers can be hidden to simplify the board view. You can hide a layer
even if it is the active layer.

### Display order for board layers

The display order for board layers is dynamic and depends on which layer
is selected as the active layer. The active layer is always drawn on top
of other layers. In addition, layers that are related to the active
layer are drawn on top of layers that are unrelated. For example, if you
make B.Silkscreen the active layer, then all of the other back layers
(B.Cu, B.Adhesive, B.Paste, B.Mask, B.Fab, and B.Courtyard) will be
drawn on top of the front, user, and inner copper layers, with
B.Silkscreen topmost. If you make Edge.Cuts active, then it will be
drawn on top, and the User.\* layers and Margin will also be be brought
to the front.

<div class="note">

Selected objects are always drawn on top, even if they are not on the
active layer.

</div>

## The appearance panel

The appearance panel provides controls to manage the visibility, color,
and opacity of objects in the PCB Editor’s drawing canvas. It has three
tabs: the Layers tab contains controls for the board layers, the Objects
tab contains controls for different types of graphical objects, and the
Nets tab contains controls for the appearance of the ratsnest and copper
items.

### Layer controls

In the Layers tab of the appearance panel, each board layer is shown
with its color and visibility state. The active layer is shown
highlighted with an arrow indicator to the left of the color swatch.
Left-click on a layer to choose it as the active layer. Left-click on
the corresponding visibility icon to toggle the layer between visible
and hidden. Double-click or middle-click on the color swatch to change
the layer’s color.

<div class="note">

You must first create a custom color theme in Preferences before you can
change layer colors in the appearance panel.

</div>

Below the list of layers is an expandable panel that contains layer
display options. The first setting controls how non-active layers are
displayed: normal, dimmed, or hidden. The layer display mode can be used
to simplify the view and focus on a single layer. Items on inactive
layers cannot be selected when the non-active layer display mode is
"Dim" or "Hide". You can use the hotkey
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+H</span> to cycle through these display
modes quickly.

**Flip board view** will show the board as if you are looking from the
bottom (that is, mirrored around the Y-axis). This option is also
available in the View menu.

<div class="note">

Flipping the board view does not change the visual layer ordering, the
active layer will remain in front followed by the other layers in their
normal order.

</div>

### Object controls

The Objects tab of the appearance panel is similar to the Layers tab.
The main differences are that some objects have no color setting and
that four types of objects (tracks, vias, pads, and zones) have opacity
control sliders. The opacity setting here will be multiplied with any
opacity set in the layer colors. By default, all objects are fully
opaque except for zones, which are set to translucent in order to make
it easier to see objects through filled zone areas.

### Layer presets

Layer presets store which layers and objects are visible and hidden for
easy recall. There are several built-in layer presets and you can save
your own custom presets. Custom presets are stored in the project
settings for a board, as presets may be specific to a certain board
stackup.

To load a preset, choose it from the Presets drop-down menu at the
bottom of the appearance panel or use the quick switcher by holding down
Ctrl and pressing Tab. Once the quick switcher window appears, you can
press Tab and <span class="keycombo">Shift+Tab</span> to cycle through
the available presets. When you let go of the Ctrl key, the highlighted
preset will be loaded.

To save a custom preset, first use the visibility controls to choose
which layers you want visible, then choose **Save preset…​** from the
Presets drop-down menu. Give your preset a name and it will now be
available via the drop-down menu and the quick switcher. To modify a
custom preset, follow the same process and save the modified version
with the same name to overwrite the existing version. To delete a custom
preset, choose the **Delete preset…​** option from the drop-down menu and
select the preset to be deleted from the list.

### Viewports

Viewports store the current view location and zoom level so you can
quickly switch back to it later, or switch between several saved views.

To load a viewport, choose it from the Viewports drop-down menu at the
bottom of the appearance panel or use the quick switcher by holding down
Shift and pressing Tab. Once the quick switcher window appears, you can
press Tab to cycle through the stored viewports. When you let go of the
Shift key, the highlighted viewport will be loaded.

To save a new viewport, scroll and zoom to show the desired area of the
board, then choose **Save viewport…​** from the Viewports drop-down menu.
Give your viewport a name and it will now be available via the drop-down
menu and the quick switcher. To modify an existing viewport, save a new
viewport with the same name to overwrite the existing version. To delete
a viewport, choose the **Delete viewport…​** option from the drop-down
menu and select the preset to be deleted from the list.

### Net and net class controls

The Nets tab of the appearance panel shows a list of all nets and net
classes in the board. Each net has a visibility control that controls
the visibility of that net in the ratsnest. Hiding nets in the ratsnest
does not change the connectivity of the board and will not impact the
design rule checker; it only is intended to make the ratsnest easier to
understand.

Each net and net class can also have a color assigned. By default, this
color applies to the ratsnest lines for the net (or for all the nets in
the net class). Nets have no color by default; this is indicated by a
checkerboard pattern in the color swatch. Double-click or right-click a
net or net class color swatch to set the color. To give a net class the
same color it has in the schematic, right click the net class and select
**Use color from schematic**.

<div class="note">

The Default net class cannot have a color assigned, as nets in this
class will just use the default ratsnest color defined by the color
theme.

</div>

You can also select and highlight nets and net classes via the
appearance panel: right-click on a net or net class to show these
options in a menu.

Below the list of net classes is an expandable panel that contains net
display options. The first option controls how net colors are applied.
When "All" is selected, all copper items (pads, tracks, vias, and zones)
belonging to a net or net class will take on the chosen color. When
"Ratsnest" is selected (the default value), only the ratsnest is
affected by net and net class colors. When "None" is selected, net and
net class colors are ignored.

The second option controls how ratsnest lines are drawn. "All layers"
means that ratsnest lines will be drawn between all unconnected items.
"Visible layers" means that no ratsnest lines will be drawn to items
that are on hidden layers, even when those items are unconnected.

<div class="note">

You can configure the thickness of ratsnest lines in the PCB Editor
Editing Options section of the Preferences dialog, to make the ratsnest
more or less visible.

</div>

## Selection and the selection filter

Selecting items in the editing canvas is done with the left mouse
button. Single-clicking on an object will select it and dragging will
perform a box selection. A box selection from left to right will only
select items that are fully inside the box. A box selection from right
to left will select any items that touch the box. A left-to-right
selection box is drawn in yellow, with a cursor that indicates exclusive
selection, and a right-to-left selection box is drawn in blue with a
cursor that indicates inclusive selection.

The selection action can be modified by holding modifier keys while
clicking or dragging. The following modifier keys apply when clicking to
select single items:

| Modifier Keys (Windows)                  | Modifier Keys (Linux)                    | Modifier Keys (macOS)                   | Selection Effect                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl                                     | Ctrl                                     | Cmd                                     | Toggle selection. Note: Ctrl+click can be remapped to highlight net in **Preferences** → **PCB Editor** → **Editing Options**. |
| Shift                                    | Shift                                    | Shift                                   | Add the item to the existing selection.                                                                                        |
| <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Cmd+Shift</span> | Remove the item from the existing selection.                                                                                   |
| long click                               | long click or Alt                        | long click or Option                    | Clarify selection from a pop-up menu.                                                                                          |

The following modifier keys apply when dragging to perform a box
selection:

| Modifier Keys (Windows)                  | Modifier Keys (Linux)                    | Modifier Keys (macOS)                   | Selection Effect                            |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl                                     | Ctrl                                     | Cmd                                     | Toggle selection.                           |
| Shift                                    | Shift                                    | Shift                                   | Add item(s) to the existing selection.      |
| <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Cmd+Shift</span> | Remove item(s) from the existing selection. |

The selection filter panel in the lower right corner of the PCB Editor
window controls which types of objects can be selected with the mouse.
Turning off selection of unwanted object types makes it easier to select
items in a dense board. The "All items" checkbox is a shortcut to turn
the other items on and off. The "Locked items" checkbox is independent
of the rest, and controls whether or not items that have been locked can
be selected. You can right-click any object type in the selection filter
to quickly change the filter to only allow selecting that type of
object.

<figure>
<img src="images/selection_filter.png" alt="selection filter" />
</figure>

When a connected copper item is selected, you can expand the selection
to other copper items of the same net using the Expand Selection command
in the right-click context menu or with the hotkey U. The first time you
run this command, the selection will be expanded to the nearest pad. The
second time, the selection will be expanded to all connected items on
all layers.

Selecting an object displays information about the object in the message
panel at the bottom of the window. Double-clicking an object opens a
window to edit the object’s properties.

Pressing Esc will always cancel the current tool or operation and return
to the selection tool. Pressing Esc while the selection tool is active
will clear the current selection.

## Net highlighting

An electrical net (or set of nets) can be highlighted in the PCB editor
to visualize how the net is routed across the PCB. Net highlighting can
be activated by selecting the net to highlight in the PCB editor or by
selecting the corresponding net in the schematic editor when cross-probe
highlighting is enabled (see below). When net highlighting is active,
the highlighted net or nets will be shown in a brighter color and all
other items will be shown in a dimmer color than normal.

There are several ways to select a net or nets to highlight in the PCB
editor:

- Use the hotkey \` after selecting a copper object, or while hovering
  over a copper object

- Right click a copper object in the editing canvas and select **Net
  Inspection Tools** → **Highlight Net**

- Right click a net in the **Nets** tab of the Appearance panel and
  select **Highlight**

- Double click a net in the [Net Inspector](#net-inspector)

When you press the Highlight Net hotkey, the nets of any selected copper
items will be highlighted. If no copper items are selected, the net of
the copper item under the editor cursor will be highlighted.

Net highlighting can be cleared by using the Clear Net Highlight action
(hotkey ~) or by using the Highlight net tool on an empty region in the
board. By default, Esc also clears net highlighting, but this can be
disabled if desired in **Preferences** → **PCB Editor** → **Editing
Options**.

When a net or nets have been selected for highlighting, the Toggle Net
Highlighting action becomes enabled on the left toolbar (also accessible
by hotkey, <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+\`</span>). This action will turn
the highlighting display on or off without choosing a new net to
highlight.

## Cross-probing from the schematic

KiCad allows bi-directional cross-probing between the schematic and the
PCB. There are several different types of cross-probing.

**Selection cross-probing** allows you to select a symbol or pin in the
schematic to select the corresponding footprint or pad in the PCB (if
one exists) and vice-versa. By default, cross-probing will result in the
display centering on the cross-probed item and zooming to fit. You can
disable the centering and zooming behavior, or disable selection
cross-probing entirely, in the Display Options section of the
Preferences dialog. Even when selection cross-probing is disabled, you
can manually cross-probe from the schematic to the PCB by right-clicking
an object and selecting **Select on PCB**, or from the PCB to the
schematic by right-clicking an object and choosing **Select** → **Select
on Schematic**.

**Highlight cross-probing** allows you to highlight a net in the
schematic and PCB at the same time. If the option "Highlight
cross-probed nets" is enabled in the Display Options section of the
Preferences dialog, highlighting a net or bus in the schematic editor
will cause the corresponding net or nets to be highlighted in the PCB
editor.

## Left toolbar display controls

The left toolbar provides options to change the display of items in the
PCB Editor.

# Creating a PCB

## Basic PCB concepts

A printed circuit board in KiCad is generally made up of **footprints**
representing electronic components and their pads, **nets** defining how
those pads connect to each other, **tracks**, **vias**, and **filled
zones** that form the copper connections between pads in each net, and
various graphic shapes defining the board edge, silkscreen markings, and
any other desired information.

KiCad normally keeps the information about nets on a PCB synchronized
with an associated schematic, but nets can also be created and edited
directly within the PCB editor.

## Capabilities

KiCad is capable of creating printed circuit boards with up to 32 copper
layers, 14 technical layers (silkscreen, solder mask, component
adhesive, solder paste, etc), and 13 general-purpose drawing layers.

The internal measurement resolution of all objects in KiCad is 1
nanometer, and measurements are stored as 32-bit integers. This means it
is possible to create boards up to approximately 4 meters by 4 meters.

KiCad currently supports one board file per project / schematic.

## Starting from a schematic

Creating a board from a schematic is the recommended workflow for KiCad.
When you create a new project, KiCad will generate an empty board file
with the same name as the project. To start designing the board after
you have created a schematic, simply open the board file. You can do
this either from the KiCad project manager, or by clicking the "Open PCB
in board editor" button in the schematic editor. To import the schematic
design information into the board editor, including footprints and net
connections, use the **Tools** → **Update PCB from Schematic…​** action
(F8). You can also use the ![Update pcb from schematic
icon](images/icons/update_pcb_from_sch_24.png) icon in the top toolbar.

<div class="note">

Update PCB from Schematic is the preferred way to transfer design
information from the schematic to the PCB. In older versions of KiCad,
the equivalent process was to export a netlist from the Schematic Editor
and import it into the Board Editor. It is no longer necessary to use a
netlist file.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/update_pcb_from_schematic.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Update PCB from schematic" />
</figure>

For more information about the Update Schematic from PCB tool, see the
[forward annotation section of the
manual](#forward-and-back-annotation).

## Starting from scratch

It is also possible to create a board with no matching schematic,
although this workflow has some limitations and is not recommended for
most users. To do this, you must start the PCB editor standalone (not
from the KiCad project manager). Before beginning your design, it is a
good idea to save the board file, which will also create a project file
to store board settings. Use "Save As…​" from the File menu to choose
where to save your board file. A project file with the same name will be
created in the same location you choose to save the board file in.

## Board setup

Before beginning your board design, use the Board Setup dialog to
configure the basic parameters of the board. To open Board Setup, click
the ![options board](images/icons/options_board.png) icon in the top
toolbar or choose "Board Setup…​" from the File menu.

### Configuring board stackup and physical parameters

There are two sections of Board Setup used to configure the stackup and
layers of the board. The Board Editor Layers section is used to enable
or disable technical (non-copper) layers, and give custom names to
layers if desired. The Physical Stackup section is used to configure the
number of copper layers, as well as the physical parameters of the
copper and dielectric layers such as thickness and material type.
Dielectric, soldermask, and silkscreen layers can have colors assigned
to them, which affects the board’s appearance in the 3D viewer.

To configure the board stackup, start on the Physical Stackup section:

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_physical_stackup.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup physical stackup" />
</figure>

Set the number of copper layers in the upper left corner and then enter
the physical parameters of the stackup if desired. These parameters may
be left at their default values, but note that the board thickness value
will be used when exporting a 3D model of the board, and layer
thicknesses will be included in net length calculations for any nets
that include vias. If you plan to use these features, it is a good idea
to ensure that the stackup thickness is correct.

<div class="note">

KiCad currently only supports stackups with an even number of copper
layers. To create designs with an odd number of layers (for example,
flexible printed circuits or metal-core printed circuits), simply choose
the next highest even number and ignore the extra layer.

</div>

Next, if desired, use the Board Editor Layers section to rename layers
or hide non-copper layers that you will not be using in the design. For
example, if you will not use a back silkscreen on the design, uncheck
the box next to the `B.Silkscreen` layer. Some layers, like `F.Cu` /
`B.Cu` or `Edge.Cuts`, are required layers and therefore cannot be
disabled.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_board_editor_layers.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="board setup board editor layers" />
</figure>

<div class="note">

Copper layers can be designated as signal, power plane, mixed, or jumper
in the Board Editor Layers section. This designation is intended as a
guide for the user only. Tracks and zones can be routed on any copper
layer, no matter what the type is configured to in this dialog.

</div>

You can add additional user-defined layers (`User.1`, `User.2`, etc.) by
clicking the **Add User Defined Layer…​** button in the top right.
User-defined layers can’t be used for routing, but they can contain
arbitrary graphics or other information. By default, user layers are
**auxiliary** layers, meaning that whatever information they contain
does not correspond to either the front or back of the board. User
layers can instead be set to **Off-board, front** or **Off-board,
back**, in which case they correspond to the selected side of the board.
Items on such layers can be flipped from front to back in the same way
as objects on physical front/back layers. Adjacent front/back layers are
treated as paired: if `User.2` is defined as a front layer and `User.3`
is defined as a back layer, flipping an object on `User.2` will move it
to `User.3`, and vice versa.

Some additional board stackup settings are found on the Board Finish and
Solder Mask/Paste sections of the Board Setup dialog. The Board Finish
section has settings for defining the copper finish and special features
such as castellations or edge plating. Note that these settings only
impact the board attributes output as part of Gerber job files at this
time.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_board_finish.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup board finish" />
</figure>

The Solder Mask/Paste section allow global adjustment of the clearance
(positive or negative) between the copper shapes and solder mask /
solder paste shapes of pads on the board. These values will be added to
any clearance overrides set on individual footprints or pads. Positive
clearance values will result in the shape of the solder mask or paste
opening being *larger* than the copper shape. Negative clearance values
will result in the opening being *smaller* than the copper shape.

<div class="warning">

Most commercial PCB fabricators expect these values to be zero and make
their own adjustments to solder mask and paste openings as part of their
CAM process. It is usually best to leave these values at their default
of zero unless you are making the PCB yourself or have specific advice
from your fabricator to use different values.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_solder_mask_paste.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup solder mask paste" />
</figure>

### Configuring default text and graphic settings

The Text & Graphics Defaults section of the Board Setup dialog can be
used to configure the properties that will be used for new text and
graphic shapes that are placed on the board.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_text_and_graphics.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup text and graphics" />
</figure>

Line thickness, text size, and text appearance can be configured for the
six different categories of layers shown in the dialog. Additionally,
the properties for dimension objects can be configured for all layers.
For more details about dimension properties, see the Dimensions section
below.

Dashed line appearance is controlled in the Formatting section. **Dash
length** controls the length of dashes, while **Gap length** controls
the spacing between dashes and dots. The dash and gap lengths are
relative to the line width: a gap length of `2` means twice the width of
the line.

Text replacement variables can be created in the Text Variables section.
These variables allow you to substitute the variable name for any text
string. This substitution happens anywhere the variable name is used
inside the variable replacement syntax of `${VARIABLENAME}`.

For example, you could create a variable named `VERSION` and set the
text substitution to `1.0`. Now, in any text object on the PCB, you can
enter `${VERSION}` and KiCad will substitute `1.0`. If you change the
substitution to `2.0`, every text object that includes `${VERSION}` will
be updated automatically. You can also mix regular text and variables.
For example, you can create a text object with the text
`Version: ${VERSION}` which will be substituted as `Version: 1.0`.

Text variables can also be created in [Schematic
Setup](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#schematic-setup). Text variables are
project-wide; variables created in the schematic editor are also
available in the board editor, and vice versa.

There are also a number of [built-in system text
variables](#text-variables).

### Configuring design rules

Design rules control the behavior of the interactive router, the filling
of copper zones, and the [design rule checker](#design-rule-checking).
Design rules can be modified at any time, but we recommend that you
establish all known design rules at the beginning of the board design
process.

#### Constraints

Basic design rules are configured in the Constraints section of the
Board Setup dialog. Constraints in this section apply to the entire
board and should be set to the values recommended by your board
manufacturer. Any minimum value set here is an *absolute* minimum and
cannot be overridden with a more specific design rule. For example, if
you need the copper clearance on part of a board to be 0.2mm and in the
rest 0.3mm, you must enter 0.2mm for the minimum copper clearance in the
Constraints section and use a net class or custom rule to set the larger
0.3mm clearance.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_constraints.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup constraints" />
</figure>

In addition to setting minimum clearances, a number of features can be
configured here:

| Setting                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Arc/circle approximated by segments                 | In some situations, KiCad must use a series of straight line segments to approximate round shapes such as those of arcs and circles. This setting controls the maximum error allowed by this approximation: in other words, the maximum distance between a point on one of these line segments and the true shape of the arc or circle. Setting this to a lower number than the default value of 0.005mm will result in smoother shapes, but can be very slow on larger boards. The default value typically results in arc approximation error that is not detectable in the manufactured board due to manufacturing tolerances. |
| Allow fillets outside zone outline                  | Zones can have fillets (rounded corners) added in the Zone Properties dialog. By default, no zone copper, including fillets, is allowed outside the zone outline. This effectively means that inside corners of the zone outline will not be filleted even when a fillet is configured. By enabling this setting, inside corners of the zone outline will be filleted even though this results in copper from the zone extending outside the zone outline.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Minimum thermal relief spoke count                  | This sets the minimum acceptable number of thermal relief spokes connecting a pad to a zone. A DRC violation will be generated if this constraint is violated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Include stackup height in track length calculations | By default, the length tuner uses the height of the stackup to calculate the additional length of a track that travels through vias from one layer to another. This calculation relies on the board stackup height being correctly configured. In some situations, it is preferable to ignore the height of vias and just calculate the track length assuming that vias add no length. Disabling this setting will exclude via length from length tuner track length calculations.                                                                                                                                               |

#### Pre-defined Sizes

The pre-defined sizes section allows you to define the track and via
dimensions you want to have available while routing tracks. Net classes
can be used to define the default dimensions for tracks and vias in
different nets (see below) but defining a list of sizes in this section
will allow you to step through these sizes while routing. For example,
you may want the default track width on a board to be 0.2 mm, but use
0.3 mm for some sections that carry more current, and 0.15 mm for some
sections where space is limited. You can define each of these track
widths in the Board Setup dialog and then switch between them when
routing tracks.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_predefined_sizes.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup predefined sizes" />
</figure>

#### Teardrops

The teardrops section lets you set default parameters for various types
of teardrops. There are different settings for teardrop connections to
round objects, rectangular objects, and teardrop connections between
tracks. The default teardrop parameters can be overridden when teardrops
are added, and also changed in the properties for individual connected
items. See the [teardrops documentation](#editing-teardrops) for more
information about each setting.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_teardrops.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup teardrops" />
</figure>

#### Length-tuning patterns

The length-tuning patterns section lets you set default parameters for
each type of length-tuning pattern (single-track length,
differential-pair length, and differential-pair skew). These defaults
can be overridden in the properties of each tuning pattern added to the
board. See the [length tuning documentation](#length-tuning) for more
information.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_length_tuning_patterns.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="board setup length tuning patterns" />
</figure>

#### Net Classes

The Net Classes section allows you to configure routing and clearance
rules for different classes of nets.

More than one net class can be assigned to a net. For nets with multiple
net classes assigned, an effective aggregate net class is formed, taking
any net class properties from the highest priority net class which has
that property set. Net class priority is determined by the ordering in
the Schematic or Board Setup dialogs. The `Default` net class is used as
a fallback for any missing properties after all explicit net classes
have been considered; this means that nets may be part of the `Default`
net class even if they have other net classes explicitly assigned.

[Net classes may be created and
edited](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#schematic-setup-netclasses) in either
the Schematic or Board Setup dialogs.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_netclasses.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup netclasses" />
</figure>

The upper portion of the Net Classes section contains a table showing
the net classes in the design and the design rules that apply to each
net class. Every class has values for copper clearance, track width, via
sizes, and differential pair sizes. These values will be used when
creating tracks and vias unless a more specific rule overrides them (see
Custom Rules below).

<div class="note">

No rule may override the minimum values set in the Constraints section
of Board Setup. For example, if you set a net class clearance to
`0.1 mm`, but the Minimum Clearance in the Constraints section is set to
`0.2 mm`, nets in that class will have a clearance of `0.2 mm`.

</div>

The track widths and via sizes defined for each net class are used when
the track width and via size controls are set to "use netclass values"
in the PCB editor. These widths and sizes are considered the default, or
optimal, sizes for that net class. They are not minimum or maximum
values. Manually changing the track width or via size to a different
value from that defined in the Net Classes section will not result in a
DRC violation. To restrict track width or via size to specific values,
use [Custom Rules](#custom-design-rules).

Each net class can also have a color assigned to it. Depending on how
net colors are configured in the [appearance panel](#appearance-panel),
net class colors can override the default color for ratsnest lines or
copper objects. In addition to arbitrary colors for each net class, you
can set all net classes to use the same color as configured for them in
the schematic editor by clicking the **Import colors from schematic**
button. To use a layer’s default color instead of overriding it with a
custom net class color, set the net class color to transparent.

The lower portion of the Net Classes section lists pattern-based net
class assignments. Working with pattern-based net class assignments is
explained in the [Schematic Editor
documentation](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#schematic-setup-netclasses);
pattern-based assignments can be edited in either the Board or Schematic
Setup windows.

Note that pattern-based assignments can be created directly from the PCB
editing canvas by right clicking a copper track or zone and clicking
**Assign netclass…​**. Net classes can also be assigned in the schematic
using [net class directives or
labels](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#netclass-directive ) instead of
pattern-based assignments.

#### Custom Rules

The Custom Rules section contains a text editor for creating design
rules using the custom rules language. Custom rules are used to create
specific design rule checks that are not covered by the basic
constraints or net class settings.

Custom rules will only be applied if there are no errors in the custom
rules definitions. Use the Check Rule Syntax button to test the
definitions and fix any problems before closing Board Setup.

See [Custom Design Rules](#custom-design-rules) in the Advanced Topics
chapter for more information on the custom rules language as well as
example rules.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_custom_rules.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup custom rules" />
</figure>

#### Violation Severity

The Violation Severity section allows you to configure the severity of
each type of design rule check. Each rule may be set to create an error
marker, a warning marker, or no marker (ignored).

<div class="note">

Individual rule violations may be ignored in the Design Rule Checker.
Setting a rule to Ignore in the Violation Severity section will
completely disable the corresponding design rule check. Use this setting
with caution.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_violation_severity.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup violation severity" />
</figure>

For descriptions of each violation type, and how to ignore individual
violations without disabling all violations of that type, see the [DRC
documentation](#design-rule-checking).

### Embedding files

External files can be embedded within a board file. Embedding a file
stores a copy of the file inside the board file. The design can then
refer to the embedded copy of the file instead of the external file,
which makes the project more portable as it doesn’t rely on an external
file. Fonts, datasheets, drawing sheets, SPICE models, and footprint 3D
models can be embedded and used within KiCad. Other arbitrary files can
also be embedded to store them in the project for later export, but they
are not used by any KiCad functionality. Files embedded in a board
necessarily increase the board’s file size, although files are
compressed before being embedded to minimize the space required.

<figure>
<img src="images/embedded_files.png" alt="embedded files" />
</figure>

Embedded files are managed in the Embedded Files section of Board Setup.
All files embedded in a board are shown here. To embed a file inside a
board, click the ![small folder 16](images/icons/small_folder_16.png)
button and select the file. The file is then embedded inside the PCB and
is listed in the embedded files list along with its *embedded
reference*. The embedded reference is a unique identifier for the
embedded file that begins with `kicad-embed://`. You can use the
embedded reference elsewhere in the Board Editor to refer to the
embedded file as if it were an external file path. You can copy the
embedded reference by right clicking and selecting **Copy Embedded
Reference**. To remove an embedded file, click the ![small trash
16](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button. Any remaining links to the
removed file will become invalid.

<div class="note">

3D models and drawing sheets can be embedded directly using the file
browser when you add them to a footprint ([3D
models](#editing-symbol-properties)) or to a board ([drawing
sheets](#sheet-title-block)) by enabling the **Embed Files** option in
the file browser. This is a single-step shortcut for adding the files in
Board Setup and then referring to them by their embedded reference; the
result is the same.

</div>

To embed any fonts used in a board, check the **Embed fonts** checkbox.
All fonts used in the board design will be embedded, so text using that
font can be edited on any computer regardless of whether the font file
is installed.

You can also [embed files in a footprint](#fp-embedding-files), either
in the board copy of a footprint or in a library. Such files will be
available within the footprint instance but not within the larger board
design or within other footprints. Files embedded in a footprint are
deduplicated when the footprint is added to a board: if a file is
embedded in a footprint, and multiple instances of that footprint are
added to the board, only one copy of the file will be embedded, and all
of the footprint instances will refer to the same embedded file.

As an example, to embed a 3D model in a project and use it within
several footprints, you could embed the model using the Board Setup
dialog, copy the internal reference, and paste the internal reference as
a 3D model path in each footprint that uses that model. Alternatively,
you could embed the model within a single footprint, either in the board
or in the source footprint library. In this case, the footprint itself
is portable if you export the footprints from the board, and the model
embedding is managed in the footprint’s properties rather than Board
Setup. A more convenient way to achieve the same thing, however, is to
open the footprint’s properties dialog, add a 3D model file, and enable
the **Embed File** option in the file browser. Again, this could be done
for a footprint in the board or for a footprint in the source footprint
library.

Files can also be embedded in
[schematics](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#sch-embedding-files).

### Importing settings

You can import part or all of the board setup from an existing board.
This technique can be used to create a "template" board that has the
settings you want to use on multiple designs, and then importing these
settings from the template board into each new board rather than
entering them manually.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_import_settings.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup import settings" />
</figure>

To import settings, click the **Import Settings from Another Board…​**
button at the bottom of the Board Setup dialog and then choose the
`kicad_pcb` file you want to import from. Select which settings you want
to import and the current settings will be overwritten with the values
from the chosen board.

The settings that are available to import are:

- Board layers and physical stackup

- Solder mask/paste defaults

- Text and graphics default properties

- Text & graphics formatting

- Design rule constraints

- Predefined track & via dimensions

- Teardrop defaults

- Length-tuning pattern defaults

- Net classes

- Custom rules

- Violation severities

# Editing a board

## Placement and drawing operations

Placement and drawing tools are located in the right toolbar. When a
tool is activated, it stays active until a different tool is selected or
the tool is canceled with the Esc key. The selection tool is always
activated when any other tool is canceled.

Some toolbar buttons have more than one tool available in a palette.
These tools are indicated with a small arrow in the lower-right corner
of the button: ![pcbnew palette
buttons](images/pcbnew_palette_buttons.png)

To show the palette, you can click and hold the mouse button on the tool
or click and drag the mouse. The palette will show the most recently
used tool when it is closed.

## Grids and snapping

When moving, dragging, and drawing board elements, you can make these
operations snap to a grid or to snapping points on pads and other items.
In complex designs, snap points can be so close together that it makes
the current tool action difficult. Both grid and object snapping can be
disabled while moving the mouse by using the modifier keys in the table
below.

<div class="note">

On Apple keyboards, use the Cmd key instead of Ctrl.

</div>

| Modifier Key | Effect                   |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Ctrl         | Disable grid snapping.   |
| Shift        | Disable object snapping. |

Tools only snap to objects on visible layers. You can reduce unwanted
snapping points by hiding unneeded layers or using the single-layer view
mode. Additionally, you can toggle between snapping to objects on all
layers or only snapping to objects on the current layer by pressing
<span class="keycombo">Shift+S</span>.

Snapping to different types of objects (pads, tracks, and graphics) can
be configured in the Editing Options section of the PCB Editor
preferences.

### Snapping to graphical shapes

When working with [graphic shapes](#graphical-shapes) like rectangles or
arcs, such as when drawing shapes or when selecting a reference point
for a move operation, many additional snapping points are available that
let you snap to features of existing graphic shapes.

Available snapping points for graphic shapes include:

- Endpoints and corners

- Midpoints

- Centers

- Intersection points

When you hover over a snap point with a shape tool active, a graphical
icon will be shown that indicates a snapping point is active and
explains the type of snapping point. Clicking will use that snapping
point. Some shapes display auxiliary snapping lines that appear when you
snap to part of that object. For example, line segments display an
auxiliary line that continues the segment beyond its endpoint, and arcs
display an auxiliary circle that completes the arc’s circumference.
Auxiliary shapes can be used for snapping just like the original shape.
An auxiliary line and circle are shown as a solid purple line in the
screenshot below. The cursor indicates that the active snapping point is
the endpoint of a line.

<figure>
<img src="images/snapping_point.png" alt="snapping point" />
</figure>

If you move the cursor away from the snapping point, a horizontal or
vertical dashed line will appear, depending on the direction of motion.
This indicates a horizontal or vertical projection from the snapping
point, respectively. Following the line will maintain a position that is
horizontally or vertically aligned to the original snap point. This
projection is shown as a purple dashed line in the screenshot below.

<figure>
<img src="images/snapping_point_projection.png"
alt="snapping point projection" />
</figure>

### Grid settings

Interactive editing operations are snapped to the active grid. You can
adjust the grid size using the grid dropdown in the top toolbar or by
right-clicking and selecting a new grid from the list in the **Grid**
submenu. Pressing the n or N hotkeys will cycle to the next and previous
grid in the list, respectively.

You can also select a new grid or edit the available grids in the
**Grids** pane of the preferences dialog. As a shortcut to reach this
dialog, right click the ![show grid button](images/icons/grid_24.png)
button on the left toolbar and select **Edit Grids…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/grid_panel.png" alt="grid settings dialog" />
</figure>

In this dialog you can select an active grid from the list of grids,
reorder the list of grids (![small up 16](images/icons/small_up_16.png)
/ ![small down 16](images/icons/small_down_16.png)), and add (![small
plus 16](images/icons/small_plus_16.png)), remove (![small trash
16](images/icons/small_trash_16.png)), or edit (![small edit
16](images/icons/small_edit_16.png)) grids. Grids defined in this dialog
can have unequal X and Y spacing as well as an optional name. The grid
spacing and name are specified when you create or edit a grid.

This dialog also lets you designate two grids from the list as "Fast
Grids", which can be quickly selected using
<span class="keycombo">Alt+1</span> and
<span class="keycombo">Alt+2</span>.

Finally, you can configure grid overrides for different types of
objects. Grid overrides let you set particular grid sizes for different
types of objects which will be used instead of the default grid when
working with those objects. For example, you can set a 100 mil grid for
footprints and pads while using smaller grids to finely position tracks,
vias, and text. Grid overrides can be individually enabled and disabled
in this dialog, or globally enabled and disabled using the ![grid
override enable button](images/icons/grid_override_24.png) button on the
left toolbar (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+G</span>).

To change the origin (zero point) of the grid, use **Place** → **Grid
Origin** and click to place the origin in the canvas. This function is
also available with the ![grid origin
button](images/icons/grid_select_axis_24.png) button in the right
toolbar. Alternatively, you can enter explicit coordinates for the grid
origin with **Edit** → **Grid Origin…​**.

<div class="note">

The grid origin is one of several different origins in KiCad, which
aren’t necessarily set to the same point. The grid origin is the point
that the grid aligns to; shifting the grid origin also shifts every grid
point. The page origin is an absolute origin which is always the top
left corner of the drawing sheet. The drill/place file origin is a
configurable point that can be used for fabrication outputs (**Place** →
**Drill/Place File Origin**). Finally, the local origin is a quickly
settable relative origin that current cursor location by pressing Space;
the cursor coordinates relative to the local origin are displayed in the
status bar.

</div>

The visual appearance of the grid can also be customized in several
ways. You can change the thickness of the grid markings, switch their
shape (dots, lines, or crosses), and set the minimum displayed spacing
in the **Display Options** page of the preferences dialog, and you can
change the grid color in the **Colors** page of the preferences dialog.

The grid can be shown or hidden using the ![show grid
button](images/icons/grid_24.png) button on the left-hand toolbar. By
default the grid is still active even if it is hidden, but this is
configurable in the **Display Options** preferences page. There you can
set the grid to be disabled when it is hidden or even disable the grid
entirely.

## Editing object properties

All objects have properties that are editable in a dialog. Use the
hotkey E or select **Properties** from the right-click context menu to
edit the properties of selected item(s). You can only open the
properties dialog if all the items you have selected are of the same
type. For many object types, like footprints, you can only edit the
properties of a single item at one time. To edit the properties of
multiple items at once, including items with different types, you can
use the Properties Manager.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_properties.png" alt="footprint properties" />
</figure>

You can also view and edit item properties using the Properties Manager.
The Properties Manager is a docked panel that displays the properties of
the selected item or items for editing. If multiple types of items are
selected at once, the properties panel displays only the properties
shared by all of the selected item types.

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_properties_manager.png"
alt="Properties Manager showing properties for a footprint" />
</figure>

Editing a property in the Properties Manager immediately applies the
change. When multiple items are selected, property modifications are
applied to each selected item individually, not to the whole selection
as a group. For example, when changing the orientation of multiple
items, each item is individually rotated around its own origin, not the
group’s origin.

Show the Properties Manager with **View** → **Panels** → **Properties**
or the ![Properties Manager icon](images/icons/tools_24.png) button on
the left toolbar.

Several tools are available for editing properties of specific types of
objects in bulk. For text and graphical items, including footprint
fields and dimensions, you can use the [Edit Text and Graphics
Properties tool](#pcbnew-edit-text-and-graphics-properties). Tracks and
vias can be bulk-edited using the [Edit Track and Via Properties
tool](#track-and-via-properties). Teardrop properties can be edited with
the [Edit Teardrops tool](#editing-teardrops).

In properties dialogs and many other dialogs, any field that contains a
numeric value can also accept a basic math expression that results in a
numeric value.

For example, a dimension may be entered as `2 * 2mm`, resulting in a
value of `4mm`. Basic arithmetic operators as well as parentheses for
defining order of operations are supported.

## Board outlines (Edge Cuts)

KiCad uses graphical objects on the `Edge.Cuts` layer to define the
board outline. The outline must be a continuous (closed) shape, but can
be made up of different types of graphical object such as lines and
arcs, or be a single object such as a rectangle or polygon. If no board
outline is defined, or the board outline is invalid, some functions such
as the 3D viewer and some design rule checks will not be functional.

For the board outline to be considered valid, the endpoints of any
shapes in the outline must coincide *exactly*. If any endpoints are not
coincident with another endpoint, the outline will not be considered
closed. Outline shapes also cannot intersect each other or overlap. In
such cases, [DRC will report a "Board has malformed outline"
violation](#dfm-drc) that points to the problematic parts of the
outline.

<div class="note">

You can use the [grid or the snapping tools](#grids-and-snapping) to
ensure outline endpoints exactly coincide. The [Heal
Shapes](#shape-modification-tools) tool can also be used to fix small
gaps between endpoints.

</div>

If there are multiple closed shapes on the `Edge.Cuts` layer, each shape
acts as an independent board outline. When an outline shape completely
encloses another outline, the outermost shape is considered the outside
edge of the board. Any closed shapes inside the outer shape are
considered interior cutouts in the board. Each closed outline cannot
intersect or overlap with other outlines.

Zones only fill when they are within the board outline. Any portion of a
zone that is outside of the board outline, including inside an interior
cutout, will not be filled.

## Working with footprints

### Adding footprints to the board

Footprints are automatically added to the board when the PCB is [updated
from the schematic](#forward-and-back-annotation). The footprint
associated with each schematic symbol is added to the board if it is not
already present, and each footprint pad is associated with the
corresponding symbol pin’s net. Symbol pins are matched to footprint
pads by pin/pad number.

When footprints are added to the board after an update from the
schematic, they are clustered by schematic sheet and by geographical
location in the schematic. They are initially attached to the cursor;
you can place them by clicking in the desired location.

You can also add footprints to the board manually using the [Add
Footprint
tool](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#assigning-footprints-in-symbol-properties)
(A or the ![module 24](images/icons/module_24.png) button).

<div class="note">

Footprints added in this way will not be automatically associated with a
symbol or have nets assigned to their pads, and subsequent updates from
the schematic will remove these unassociated footprints unless the
footprint is locked or the **Delete footprints with no symbols** option
is unchecked in the Update PCB From Schematic dialog. For these reasons,
it is usually recommended to avoid manually adding footprints to the
board. Manually adding footprints is necessary for [PCB-only
workflows](#starting-from-scratch), and can also be useful for adding
logos or other footprints that do not need a corresponding schematic
symbol.

</div>

### Placing and moving footprints

Once footprints have been added to the board, you can reposition them in
many ways.

The Move command (M) moves a footprint or a selection of footprints,
ignoring any connected track segments that are not selected. No DRC
checking is done when moving footprints with the Move command, although
any footprint courtyards that collide with the moved footprint’s
courtyard will be highlighted.

There is a reference point for the move operation, which is the point in
the footprint which attaches to the cursor and therefore the point in
the footprint that snaps to the grid and to other objects. The reference
point during a move is determined by the location of the cursor when the
Move command is initiated. If the cursor is over a pad, the pad’s center
will be used as the reference point. If the cursor is not over a pad,
the footprint’s anchor (coordinate origin point) will be used. To select
an arbitrary snapping point, you can use the Move With Reference command
instead of the regular Move command (right click → **Positioning Tools**
→ **Move with Reference**). After initiating the command, click on the
desired reference point; KiCad will then begin the move with that point
as the reference.

You can also use the Drag command (D) to move the selected footprint
using the interactive router, maintaining all track connections to the
footprint. Dragging footprints behaves like the Highlight Collisions
router mode: obstacles will not be avoided or shoved, only highlighted.
Ordinarily the router will prevent you from dragging a footprint into a
position that violates DRC: when you click to commit a drag in a
position that violates DRC, the footprint will return to its original
position. To force a drag to be committed even if it violates DRC,
Ctrl-click to commit the drag. Like the Move command, colliding
courtyards are highlighted.

<div class="note">

Only tracks that end at the origin of the footprint’s pads will be
dragged. Tracks that simply pass through the pad or that end on the pad
at a location other than the origin will not be dragged.

</div>

You can move a footprint to the opposite side of the board with the Flip
command (F). Any parts of the footprint on a front layer will be swapped
to the corresponding back layer, and vice versa.

Footprints can be rotated counter-clockwise using the R hotkey, or
clockwise using <span class="keycombo">Shift+R</span>. By default,
footprints are rotated by 90 degrees every time the rotate command is
used, but you can configure the rotation angle step in **Preferences** →
**PCB Editor** → **Editing Options**.

You can directly set a footprint’s exact absolute position, rotation
angle, and PCB side using either the Footprint Properties dialog or the
Properties panel.

To reposition a footprint relative to its current position, use the Move
Exactly tool (<span class="keycombo">Shift+M</span>). The dialog lets
you specify an X and Y translation, as well as a rotation, that will be
applied to the footprint. The rotation can be performed relative to
either the footprint’s anchor, the local coordinate origin, or the
drill/place origin. You can also use polar coordinates instead of
Cartesian coordinates.

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_move_exactly.png" alt="Move Exactly dialog" />
</figure>

To position a footprint relative to another object, you can use the
Position Relative tool (<span class="keycombo">Shift+P</span>). With
this tool, you select a reference point for the move and specify an
offset. The footprint is moved to the specified offset relative to the
reference point. The reference point can be one of the following:

- The local origin, which is set to the cursor position when you press
  Space.

- The grid origin, which is configured in the Grids dialog.

- The location of an arbitrary item on the board, such as a specific pad
  in a footprint. After clicking the **Select Item…​** button, click on
  the desired board item in the canvas to set the reference point.

- An arbitrary point in the canvas. After clicking the **Select Point…​**
  button, click at the desired location to set the reference point. You
  can use object snapping to select a specific point in an object, such
  as the end of a graphic line.

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_position_relative_to.png"
alt="Position Relative To Reference Item dialog" />
</figure>

To position a footprint such that an arbitrary point in the footprint is
positioned a certain distance from another arbitrary reference point,
you can use the Position Interactively tool (right click a footprint →
**Positioning Tools** → **Position Interactively…​**).

This tool lets you interactively select two points that form the start
and end of a position vector. The first point is a reference point in
the footprint, and will move along with the footprint. The second point
is a fixed reference that will remain stationary when the footprint is
moved. The vector from the first point to the second point is shown
graphically in the editing canvas. You can then give new X and Y (or
polar) dimensions for the vector, which will move the footprint
reference relative to the fixed reference such that the fixed reference
is the specified distance from the footprint reference point. The dialog
initially contains the vector dimensions before any move is performed,
or in other words the initial distance between the footprint reference
point to the fixed reference.

<figure>
<img src="images/position_interactively.png"
alt="position interactively" />
</figure>

You can swap the position of two selected footprints using the Swap
command (<span class="keycombo">Alt+S</span>). The first footprint is
assigned the location, rotation, and board side of the second footprint,
and vice versa. If there are more than two footprints selected, the
locations are cycled: the last footprint gets the position of the first
footprint, the first footprint gets the location of the second, and so
on.

There are several convenience features that make it easier to find,
select, and move specific footprints or footprints related to another
footprint.

The Get and Move Footprint command (T) prompts you to choose a footprint
from a list or by typing a reference designator. KiCad then attaches the
chosen footprint to your cursor for a move operation.

There are two commands to select other footprints that need to be
connected to the selected footprint but don’t yet have routed
connections. The Select All Unconnected Footprints command (O) selects
all footprints that have ratsnest lines to the currently selected
footprints. The command can be executed repeatedly to further expand the
selection based on the newly selected items. The Grab Nearest
Unconnected Footprint command (<span class="keycombo">Shift+O</span>)
selects the closest footprint with ratsnest lines to the currently
selected footprint, and additionally begins to move it. If there are
multiple footprints initially selected, the command will act like the
Move Individually command described below, individually moving the
closest unconnected footprint for each of the initially selected
footprints.

You can select footprints based on their schematic sheet using the right
click → **Select** → **Items in Same Hierarchical Sheet** command, which
selects all other footprints that are in the same schematic sheet as the
originally selected footprint.

If you want to move multiple selected footprints in sequence, use the
Move Individually command (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+M</span>). After
triggering the command, KiCad will begin moving the first selected
footprint. After you click to place the footprint, KiCad will
immediately start moving the next footprint, in the same order that you
selected the footprints. You can skip moving a footprint by pressing
Tab, commit the current move and skip any remaining moves by
double-clicking, or cancel all moves (including those already completed)
by pressing Esc.

If you want to move a collection of footprints at once into one area,
the Pack and Move Footprints command (P) closely packs the selected
footprints together and moves them as a block.

<div class="tip">

Move Individually and Pack and Move Footprints are useful in combination
with other selection convenience features, such as cross-selection from
the schematic or the advanced footprint selection features described
above. For example, you could select a group of bypass capacitors in the
Schematic Editor, switch to the PCB Editor where the corresponding
footprints are now selected, and then use Move Individually to quickly
place all of the bypass capacitor footprints close to their respective
ICs. Alternatively, you could use one of the other selection tools, such
as Select All Unconnected Footprints, to select many footprints from all
over the board, then use Pack and Move Footprints to quickly put them
all into a small area.

</div>

Finally, KiCad can automatically place footprints onto the board. The
auto-place function attempts to optimally place footprints to simplify
ratsnest connections to other footprints. You can auto-place the
selected footprints with **Place** → **Auto-Place Footprints** → **Place
Selected Footprints**, or auto-place all footprints outside of the board
outline with **Place** → **Auto-Place Footprints** → **Place Off-Board
Footprints**.

### Editing Footprints

Footprints in the board can be individually edited, both in terms of
their properties (fields, attributes, clearance settings, etc.) and in
terms of their physical pads and graphics. Editing a footprint in the
board only affects that particular instance of the footprint; it does
not affect any other copies of that footprint in the board, and it does
not affect the library footprint.

To edit the properties of a footprint in the board, open its properties
dialog (E)

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_properties.png" alt="footprint properties" />
</figure>

The majority of the settings in this dialog are the same as in the
[footprint editor](#footprint-editor-properties). You can edit the
footprint’s fields, attributes, clearance and zone connection settings,
3D models, and [embedded files](#fp-embedding-files), as in the
footprint editor. However, here you can also set the footprint’s
position, orientation, and side. You can also update the footprint from
the library, exchange it for a different footprint, or edit the
footprint itself in the footprint editor.

To edit the footprint’s physical form, i.e. its pads and graphics, you
need to use the [footprint editor](#creating-and-editing-footprints).
There are two buttons for opening a footprint in the editor, depending
on whether you want to edit a single copy of a footprint in the board or
a footprint’s source copy in the library.

- **Edit Footprint…​** will open the specific instance of the footprint
  in the footprint editor. Editing this footprint will only affect this
  one instance of the footprint in the board. It will not affect other
  instances of the footprint in the board, and it will not affect the
  library copy of the footprint. You can also open a board footprint in
  the footprint editor by right clicking the footprint in the board and
  selecting **Open in footprint editor**
  (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+E</span>).

- **Edit Library Footprint…​** will open the library copy of the
  footprint in the footprint editor. Editing the library copy of the
  footprint will edit the footprint in the footprint library, but will
  not immediately affect any instances of that footprint in the board.
  To update footprints in the board with changes to the library
  footprint, use the **Update Footprint from Library…​** tool. Editing
  the library footprint in this way is equivalent to opening the
  footprint editor, opening the appropriate footprint in its library,
  and editing it.

The **Update Footprint from Library…​** button is used to update the
board’s copy of the footprint to match the copy in the library. The
**Change Footprint…​** button is used to swap the current footprint to a
different footprint in the library. These functions are described
[later](#updating-and-exchanging-footprints).

### Editing footprint fields

An individual symbol text field can be edited directly with the E hotkey
(with a field selected instead of a footprint) or by double-clicking on
the field.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_field.png" alt="footprint field" />
</figure>

The options in this dialog are the same as those in the full Footprint
Properties dialog, but are specific to a single field.

Only footprint fields can be edited this way in the board editor. Unlike
fields, Footprint text is a graphic object that can only be edited or
moved in the footprint editor.

<div class="note">

In versions of KiCad before version 8.0, footprint fields did not exist.
Instead, footprint text could be edited directly in the board editor. In
KiCad 8.0, footprint text is not editable in the board editor and can
only be edited in the footprint editor.

</div>

### Updating and exchanging footprints

When a footprint is added to the board, KiCad embeds a copy of the
library footprint in the board so that the board is independent of the
system libraries. Footprints that have been added to the board are not
automatically updated when the library changes. Library footprint
changes are manually synced to the board so that the board does not
change unexpectedly.

<div class="note">

You can use the [Compare Footprint with Library
tool](#comparing-footprints) to inspect the differences between a
footprint in a board with its corresponding library footprint.

</div>

To update footprints in the board to match the corresponding library
footprint, use **Tools** → **Update Footprints from Library…​**, or right
click a footprint and select **Update Footprint…​**. You can also access
the tool from the [footprint properties
dialog](#board-editing-footprints).

<figure>
<img src="images/update_footprints_from_library.png"
alt="update footprints from library" />
</figure>

The top of the dialog has options to choose which footprints will be
updated. You can update all footprints on the board, update only the
selected footprints, or update only the footprints that match a specific
reference designator, value, or library identifier. The reference
designator and value fields support wildcards: `*` matches any number of
any characters, including none, and `?` matches any single character.

The middle of the dialog has options to control what parts of the
footprint will be updated. You can select specific fields to update or
not update, which properties of the fields to update (text content,
visibility, size and style, and position), and how to handle fields that
are missing or empty in the library footprint. You can also choose
whether to update footprint attributes, such as footprint type, **not in
schematic**, **exclude from position files** / **bill of materials**,
**exempt from courtyard requirement**, and **do not populate**.

The bottom of the dialog displays messages describing the update actions
that have been performed.

To change an existing footprint to a different footprint, use **Edit** →
**Change Footprints…​**, or right click an existing footprint and select
**Change Footprint…​**. This dialog is also accessible from the
[footprint properties dialog](#board-editing-footprints).

<figure>
<img src="images/change_footprints.png" alt="change footprints" />
</figure>

The options for the Change Footprints dialog are very similar to the
Update Footprints from Library dialog.

### Comparing footprints between board and library

When a footprint in a board diverges from the corresponding footprint in
the original footprint library, you can use the Compare Footprint with
Library tool to inspect the differences between the two versions of the
footprint. Run the tool using **Inspect** → **Compare Footprint With
Library**.

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_compare_footprint_with_library_summary.png"
alt="Compare Footprint with Library Summary tab" />
</figure>

The **Summary** tab shows the name of the footprint, including its
library and board reference designator, and provides a list of the
differences between the board and library versions of the footprint.

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_compare_footprint_with_library_visual.png"
alt="Compare Footprint with Library Visual tab" />
</figure>

The **Visual** tab shows a visual comparison of the board and library
versions of the footprint. This can be used as a visual diff tool.

By default, the comparison displays both versions of the footprint
superimposed on each other. To see the changes more easily, you can drag
the slider at the bottom of the tab to the right to emphasize the
library version of the footprint in the superimposed view (making the
board version of the footprint more transparent) or drag it to the left
to emphasize the board version (making the library version more
transparent). At the far right and left ends of the slider, the board
and library versions of the footprint, respectively, are fully hidden.
It may be helpful to drag the slider back and forth to see the changes
more clearly.

You can press the **A/B** button, or use the / hotkey, to quickly toggle
back and forth between the board and library versions.

The screenshot above shows a visual comparison with the board version of
the footprint deemphasized. Looking at pad 1 on the left, you can see a
large, partially transparent pad (from the board footprint) surrounding
a fully opaque, smaller pad (from the library footprint). This indicates
that the pad was enlarged in the board version of the footprint, or
shrunk in the library version of the footprint.

## Working with pads

The properties of each individual pad of a footprint can be inspected
and edited after placing the footprint on the board. In other words, it
is possible to override the design of an individual footprint pad in a
specific instance of the footprint on the board, if the footprint design
in the library is not appropriate. For example, you may wish to remove
the solder paste aperture for a pad that needs to remain unsoldered in a
specific design, or you may wish to move the location of a through-hole
pad for an axial-lead resistor in order to fit a specific design.

<div class="note">

By default, the position of all footprint pads are locked, so it is
possible to edit the pad properties but not move the pad’s location
relative to the rest of the footprint. Pads may be unlocked to allow
free movement, which can be useful for certain applications (such as
through-hole footprints with varying lead positions) but is generally
never recommended for surface-mount footprints.

</div>

The pad properties dialog is opened through the context menu or default
hotkey E when a pad is selected. Note that KiCad assumes that if you
click near a pad, you are probably trying to select the entire footprint
rather than a single pad. To select a single pad, make sure to click
inside the pad area, or turn off the Footprints setting in the selection
filter (and make sure the Pads setting is turned on) to prevent
accidental selection of the entire footprint rather than a specific pad.

<figure>
<img src="images/pad_properties_general_pcb.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="pad properties general pcb" />
</figure>

This dialog lets you edit the physical properties of the pad, including
size and shape. You can also modify how the pad connects to other
objects on the board, including clearance properties, teardrops, and
thermal reliefs.

This dialog is the same as the pad properties dialog in the footprint
editor, except that here you can also manually assign a net to a pad
using the **net name** selector. The remaining options are explained in
the [Footprint Editor documentation](#footprint-pads).

<div class="note">

While you can manually assign nets to pads in the PCB editor, this is
not a typical workflow. Usually net-to-pad connections are defined by
the schematic and then [transferred to the PCB
editor](#forward-and-back-annotation).

</div>

## Working with zones

Copper zones, also sometimes called copper pours or fills by other EDA
tools, are solid or hatched areas of copper assigned to a particular net
that automatically keep clearance from other copper objects. Zones are
commonly used to fill in all free space on a board layer (or a portion
of a layer) in order to create ground and power planes, carry high
currents, or to provide shielding.

<div class="note">

Some EDA tools have separate tools for creating "plane layers" and for
creating copper zones on signal layers. In KiCad, the Copper Zone tool
is used for both these applications.

</div>

Zones are defined by a polygonal **outline** that defines the maximum
extent of the filled copper area. This outline does not represent
physical copper and will not appear in exported manufacturing data. The
actual copper areas of the zone must be **filled** each time the
outline, or any objects inside the outline, are modified. The filling
process may be run on a single zone, or on all zones in a board (default
hotkey B). Zones may be **unfilled** (default hotkey
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+B</span>) to improve performance and reduce
visual clutter while editing large boards.

<div class="note">

By default, zone filling is a manual process rather than occurring every
time an object changes that would result in a change to the zone copper.
This is because zone filling can be a slow process on older computers or
very large designs. It is important to make sure zone fills are
up-to-date before generating outputs. KiCad will check that zones have
been updated and warn you before generating outputs or running DRC when
zones have not yet been refilled. You can optionally enable automatic
zone-filling in the Preferences dialog (**PCB Editor** → **Editing
Options** → **Miscellaneous** → **Automatically refill zones**).

</div>

A zone fill occupies any unused space within the zone outline,
automatically maintaining a specified clearance to board edges, holes,
and copper objects on different nets. Zones do not fill outside of the
[board outline](#board-outlines) or within interior cutouts.

To draw a zone, click the Add Filled Zone tool (![add zone
24](images/icons/add_zone_24.png)) on the right toolbar, or use default
hotkey <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+Z</span>. Click to choose the
first point of the zone outline. The Zone Properties dialog will appear,
allowing you to choose the zone net and other properties. These
properties may be edited at any time, so it is not critical to choose
them all correctly at first. Accept the dialog and continue placing
points to define the zone outline. To finish the zone, double-click to
set the last point. Zone outline points may be modified like graphic
polygons, by dragging the square handles to move a corner or dragging
the circular handles to move an edge. To edit the zone’s properties, use
hotkey E or select Properties from the context menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/zone_properties.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="zone properties" />
</figure>

**Layer:** A single zone object can create filled copper on one or more
copper layers. Check the box next to each copper layer that this zone
outline should fill on. The copper on each layer will be filled
independently, but all layers will share the same net.

**Net:** Select the electrical net that the zone copper should be
connected to. It is possible to create zones with no net assignment.
Zones with no net will keep clearance from any copper objects on any
net.

**Zone name** can be used to assign a specific name to a zone. This name
can be used to refer to the zone in custom DRC rules.

**Zone priority level** determines the order in which multiple zones on
a single layer are filled. The highest priority level zone on a given
layer will be filled first. Lower-priority zones will keep clearance to
the filled areas of higher-priority zones. Two zones on the same layer
with the same priority level will overlap (short-circuit) with each
other, unless they are assigned different nets. When two zone outlines
with the same priority and different nets touch, one zone will maintain
clearance to the other so that they don’t short.

**Locked** controls whether or not the zone outline object is
[locked](#locking). Locked objects may not be manipulated or moved, and
cannot be selected unless the **Locked Items** option is enabled in the
Selection Filter panel.

**Outline display** controls how the zone outline is drawn on screen. In
**Line** mode, only the border lines of the outline are drawn. In
**Hatched** mode, hatch lines are drawn on the inside of the outline
border for a short distance, to make the zone outline more apparent. In
**Fully Hatched** mode, hatch lines are drawn across the entire inside
of the zone outline.

**Corner smoothing** controls the behavior of the filled copper areas at
corners of the outline. Corners can be smoothed by a chamfer or fillet,
or can extend all the way to the outline corner if smoothing is
disabled. The chamfer or fillet size is configurable when those modes
are selected.

<div class="note">

By default, chamfers and fillets are not added to **inside corners** of
the zone outline, because this would result in filled copper extending
*outside* the outline. If smooth inside corners are desired, enable the
**Allow fillets outside zone outline** option in the Constraints section
of the Board Setup dialog.

</div>

**Clearance** controls the minimum clearance the filled areas of this
zone will keep from other copper objects. Note that if two clearance
values are in conflict, the larger clearance value will be used. For
example, if a zone is set to use 0.2mm clearance but its netclass is set
to use 0.3mm clearance, the result will be an 0.3mm clearance.

**Minimum width** controls the minimum size of narrow necks of copper
created inside the zone. Any copper areas that would be below this
minimum width are removed during the filling process.

**Pad connection** controls the way that the filled zone areas will
connect to footprint pads on the same net. **Solid** connections will
result in the copper completely overlapping the pads. **Thermal
reliefs** will result in small copper spokes connecting the pad to the
rest of the copper zone, increasing the thermal resistance between the
pad and the rest of the zone. This can be useful for hand soldering.
**Reliefs for PTH** will apply thermal reliefs to plated through-hole
pads and use solid connections for surface mount pads. **None** will
result in the zone not connecting to any pads on the same net.

**Thermal relief gap** controls the distance maintained between any pad
and the copper zone when the pad connection mode is set to generate
thermal reliefs.

**Thermal spoke width** controls the width of the "spokes", or short
copper segments connecting the pad to the rest of the copper zone.

**Fill type** controls how the copper zone is filled: the default is
**solid fill**, which will result in copper filling in all available
space within the zone outline. The zone can also be set to fill a
**hatch pattern**, which will fill the area with a pattern that contains
less copper. This can be useful for flexible printed circuits and other
specialty applications.

**Orientation** controls the angle of the hatch pattern lines. An
orientation of 0 degrees will result in the hatch pattern using
horizontal and vertical lines.

**Hatch width** controls the width of each line in the hatch pattern.

**Hatch gap** controls the distance between each line in the hatch
pattern.

**Smoothing effort** controls the style of smoothing applied to the
hatch pattern. A value of 0 will result in no smoothing, and a value of
3 will result in the finest smoothing. Higher values will result in
longer processing time and larger Gerber files.

**Smoothing amount** is a ratio that controls the size of the smoothing
chamfers or fillets that are generated when **smoothing effort** is set
to a value other than 0. An amount of 0.0 results in no smoothing, and a
value of 1.0 results in maximum smoothing (in other words, a chamfer or
fillet equal to half of the hatch gap).

**Remove islands** controls the behavior of isolated copper areas, also
called islands, after the initial zone fill. When this is set to
**always**, isolated areas inside the zone are removed. When set to
**never**, isolated areas are left alone, and will result in copper
areas that are not connected to the rest of the net. When set to **below
area limit**, a **minimum island size** can be specified, and islands
below this threshold will be removed.

<div class="note">

Regardless of the **remove islands** setting, islands are never removed
from zones that are electrically unconnected. In other words, islands
are only removed from zones that have at least one electrical
connection.

</div>

### Managing zones

Instead of editing a single zone with the Zone Properties dialog, you
can use the Zone Manager tool to you view, edit, and prioritize all
zones in the board at once. To run the Zone Manager, click **Tools** →
**Zone Manager**.

<figure>
<img src="images/zone_manager.png" alt="zone manager" />
</figure>

The top left of the dialog shows a list of all zones in the board,
displaying the name (if any), net, and layers for each zone. The order
of the zones in the list reflects the priority of each zone: higher
priority zones are higher in the list. To change the priority of a zone,
use the ![small up 16](images/icons/small_up_16.png) and ![small down
16](images/icons/small_down_16.png) buttons to move it up or down in the
list. You can filter the list of zones by typing into the filter box.
The filter matches against the zones' name and/or net, depending on
which filter options are enabled.

Selecting a zone in the list shows a preview of that zone in the top
right. If the selected zone spans multiple layers, each layer is shown
individually. You can preview each layer by clicking the appropriate
layer tab above the preview.

The bottom part of the dialog shows the settings for the selected zone,
which are explained [above](#working-with-zones). You can preview the
new settings by clicking the **Update Displayed Zones** button, which
updates the zone preview without affecting the board. Changing the
properties of a zone in the Zone Manager will not update the board until
you press **OK**. If the **Refill zones** option is enabled, all zones
will be refilled when you accept the dialog. If **Refill zones** is not
enabled, zones will not be refilled until you manually refill them.

## Routing tracks

KiCad features an interactive router that:

- Allows manual or guided (semi-automatic) routing of single tracks and
  differential pairs

- Enables modifications of existing designs by:

  - Re-routing existing tracks when they are dragged

  - Re-routing tracks attached to footprint pads when the footprint is
    dragged

- Allows tuning of track lengths and differential pair skew (phase) by
  inserting serpentine  
  tuning shapes for designs with tight timing requirements

By default, the router respects the configured design rules when placing
tracks: the size (width) of new tracks will be taken from the design
rules and the router will respect the copper clearance set in the design
rules when determining where new tracks and vias can be placed. It is
possible to disable this behavior if desired by using the Highlight
Collisions router mode and turning on the Allow DRC Violations option in
the router settings (see below).

The router has three modes that can be selected at any time in the
[Interactive Router Settings dialog](#interactive-router-settings). The
router mode is used for routing new tracks, but also when dragging
existing tracks using the Drag (hotkey D) command. These modes are:

- **Highlight Collisions**: in this mode, most of the router features
  are disabled and routing is fully manual. When routing, *collisions*
  (clearance violations) will be highlighted in green and the
  newly-routed tracks cannot be fixed in place if there is a collision
  unless the Allow DRC Violations option is turned on. In this mode, up
  to two track segments may be placed at a time (for example, one
  horizontal and one diagonal segment).

- **Shove**: in this mode, the track being routed will walk around
  obstacles that cannot be moved (for example, pads and locked
  tracks/vias) and *shove* obstacles that can be moved out of the way.
  The router prevents DRC violations in this mode: if there is no way to
  route to the cursor position that does not violate DRC, no new tracks
  will be created.

- **Walk Around**: in this mode, the router behaves the same as in Shove
  mode, except no obstacles will be moved out of the way.

Which mode to use is a matter of preference. For most users, we
recommend using Shove mode for the most efficient routing experience or
Walk Around mode if you do not want the router to modify tracks that are
not being routed. Note that Shove and Walk Around modes always create
horizontal, vertical, and 45-degree (H/V/45) track segments. If you need
to route tracks with angles other than H/V/45, you must use Highlight
Collisions mode and enable the Free Angle Mode option in the
[Interactive Router Settings dialog](#interactive-router-settings).

There are four main routing functions: Route Single Track, Route
Differential Pair, Tune length of a single track, and Tune skew of a
differential pair. All of these are present in both the Route menu
dropdown (individually) on the top toolbar and the drawing toolbar in
two overloaded icons on the drawing toolbar on the right. The use of the
overloaded icons is described above. One is for the two Route functions
and one is for the two Tune functions. In addition, the Route menu
allows the selection of Set Layer Pair and Interactive Router Settings.

To route tracks, click the Route Tracks ![add tracks
24](images/icons/add_tracks_24.png) icon (from the drawing toolbar or
from the top toolbar under **Route**) or use the hotkey X. Click on a
starting location to select which net to route and begin routing. The
net being routed will automatically be highlighted and the allowable
clearance for the net will be indicated with a gray outline around the
tracks being routed. The clearance outline can be disabled by changing
the Clearance Outlines setting in the Display Options section of the
Preferences dialog.

<div class="note">

The clearance outline shows the maximum clearance from the routed net to
any other copper on the current layer. It is possible to use custom
design rules to specify different clearances for a net to different
objects. These clearances will be respected by the router, but only the
largest clearance value will be shown visually.

</div>

When the router is active, new track segments will be drawn from the
routing start point to the editor cursor. These tracks are *unfixed*
temporary objects that show what tracks will be created when you use a
left-click or the Enter key to *fix* the route. The unfixed track
segments are shown in a brighter color than the fixed track segments.
When you exit the router using the Esc key or by selecting another tool,
only the fixed track segments will be saved. The Finish Route action
(hotkey End) will fix all tracks and exit the router.

While you are routing, you can use the Undo Last Segment command (hotkey
Backspace) to unfix the tracks you most recently fixed. You can use this
command repeatedly to step back through the route that you have already
fixed.

In previous versions of KiCad, using the left mouse button or Enter to
fix the routed segments would fix all segments up to but *not including*
the segment ending at the mouse cursor location. In KiCad 6 and later,
this behavior is optional, and by default, all segments *including* the
one ending at the mouse cursor location will be fixed. The old behavior
can be restored by disabling the "Fix all segments on click" option in
the Interactive Router Settings dialog.

While routing, you can hold the Ctrl key to disable grid snapping, and
hold the Shift key to disable snapping to objects such as pads and vias.

<div class="note">

Snapping to objects can also be disabled by changing the Magnetic Points
preferences in the Editing Options section of the Preferences dialog. We
recommend that you leave object snapping enabled in general, so that you
do not accidentally end tracks slightly off-center on a pad or via.

</div>

### Interactive router settings

The interactive router settings can be accessed through the **Route**
menu, or by right-clicking on the ![Route Tracks
icon](images/icons/add_tracks_24.png) button in the toolbar. These
settings control the router behavior when routing tracks as well as when
dragging existing tracks.

This option is only available if the router mode is set to Shove.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Jump over obstacles                 | Allow the router to attempt to move colliding tracks behind solid obstacles (such as pads). This option is only available if the router mode is set to Shove.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Remove redundant tracks             | Automatically removes loops created in the currently-routed track, keeping only the most recently routed section of the loop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Optimize pad connections            | When this setting is enabled, the router attempts to avoid acute angles and other undesirable routing when exiting pads and vias.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Fix all segments on click           | When enabled, clicking while routing will fix the position of all the track segments that have been routed, including the segment that ends at the mouse cursor. A new segment will be started from the mouse cursor location. When disabled, the last segment (the one that ends at the mouse cursor) will not be fixed in place and can be adjusted by further mouse movement. |

### Track posture

When routing in H/V/45 mode, the *posture* refers to how a set of two
track segments connect two points that cannot be reached by a single
H/V/45-degree segment. In such a case, the points will be connected by
one horizontal or vertical segment and one diagonal (45-degree) segment.
The posture refers to the order of these segments: whether the
horizontal/vertical segment or the diagonal segment comes first.

![pcbnew posture a](images/pcbnew_posture_a.png) ![pcbnew posture
b](images/pcbnew_posture_b.png)

KiCad’s router attempts to pick the best posture automatically based on
a number of factors. In general, the router will attempt to minimize the
number of corners in a route, and will avoid "bad" corners such as acute
angles whenever possible. When routing from or to a pad, KiCad will
choose the posture that lines up the route with the longest edge of the
pad.

In some cases, KiCad cannot guess the posture you intend correctly. To
switch the posture of the track while routing, use the Switch Track
Posture command (hotkey /).

In situations where there is no obvious "best" posture (for example,
when starting a route from a via), KiCad will use the movement of your
mouse cursor to select the posture. If you would like the route to begin
with a straight (horizontal or vertical) segment, move the mouse away
from the starting location in a mostly horizontal or vertical direction.
If you would like the route to begin diagonally, move in a diagonal
direction. Once the cursor is a sufficient distance away from the
routing start location, the posture is set and will no longer change
unless the cursor is brought back to the starting location. Detection of
posture from the movement of the mouse cursor can be disabled in the
Interactive Router Settings dialog as described below.

<div class="note">

If you use the Switch Track Posture command to override the posture
chosen by KiCad, the automatic detection of posture from mouse movement
will be disabled for the remainder of the current routing operation.

</div>

### Track corner mode

KiCad’s router can place tracks with either sharp or rounded (arc)
corners when routing in H/V/45 mode. To switch between sharp and rounded
corners, use the Track Corner Mode command (hotkey
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+/</span>). When routing with rounded
corners, each routing step will place either a straight segment, a
single arc, or both a straight segment and an arc. The track posture
determines whether the arc or the straight segment will be placed first.

Track corners can also be rounded after routing by using the Fillet
Tracks command after selecting the tracks on either side of the corner
to be filleted. If a contiguous track selection contains multiple
corners, they will all be filleted.

<div class="note">

Dragging of tracks with arcs is not supported. Arcs are treated as
immovable by the shove router.

</div>

### Track width

The width of the track being routed is determined in one of three ways:
if the routing start point is the end of an existing track and the
![auto track width](images/icons/auto_track_width.png) button on the top
toolbar is enabled, the width will be set to the width of the existing
track. Otherwise, if the track width dropdown in the top toolbar is set
to "use netclass width", the width will be taken from the netclass of
the net being routed (or from any custom design rules that specify a
different width for the net, such as inside a neckdown area). Finally,
if the track width dropdown is set to one of the [pre-defined track
sizes](#board-setup-pre-defined-sizes) configured in the Board Setup
dialog, this width will be used.

<div class="note">

The track width can never be lower than the minimum track width
configured in the Constraints section of the Board Setup dialog. If a
pre-defined width is added that is lower than this minimum constraint,
the minimum constraint value will be used instead.

</div>

KiCad’s router supports a single track width for the active route. In
other words, to change widths in the middle of a track, you must end the
route and then restart a new route from the end of the previous route.
To change the width of the active route, use the hotkeys W and
<span class="keycombo">Shift+W</span> to step through the track widths
configured in the Board Setup dialog.

### Placing vias

While routing tracks, switching layers will insert a through via at the
end of the current (unfixed) track. Once you place the via, routing will
continue on the new layer. There are several ways to select a new layer
and insert a via:

- By using the hotkey to select a specific layer, such as PgUp to select
  `F.Cu` or PgDn to select `B.Cu`.

- By using the Next Layer or Previous Layer hotkeys (+ and -).

- By using the Place Via hotkey (V), which will switch to the next layer
  in the active layer pair.

- By using the Select Layer and Place Through Via action (hotkey \<),
  which will open a dialog to select the target layer.

After using any of the above methods to add a via and change layer, but
before clicking to fix the via and commit the current track segment, you
can cancel placing the via by pressing V. The via will be removed and
routing will continue on the original layer.

You can place a via and end the current track, without changing layers,
by pressing V and then double-clicking to place the via.

The size of the via will be taken from the active Via Size setting,
accessible from the drop-down in the top toolbar or the Increase Via
Size (') and Decrease Via Size (\\ hotkeys. Much like track width, when
the via size is set to "use netclass sizes", the via sizes configured in
the Net Classes section of the Board Setup will be used (unless
overridden by a custom design rule).

You can also place microvias and blind/buried vias while routing. Use
the hotkey <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+V</span> to place a microvia and
<span class="keycombo">Alt+Shift+V</span> to place a blind/buried via.
While regular vias always go through every board layer, microvias and
blind/buried vias can start and end on any layer, not just the outer
layers.

<div class="note">

For the purposes of DRC, microvias are not considered drilled holes as
they are laser drilled rather than mechanically drilled. See the [DRC
documentation](#list-of-drc-checks) for more information.

</div>

Vias placed by the router are considered to be part of a routed track.
This means that the via net can be updated automatically (just like
track nets can), for example when updating the PCB from the schematic
changes the net name of the track. In some cases this may not be
desired, such as when creating stitching vias. The automatic update of
via nets can be disabled for specific vias by turning off the
"automatically update via nets" checkbox in the via properties dialog.
Vias placed with the Add Free-standing Vias tool are created with this
setting disabled.

### Layer Pairs

The active layer is swapped with the other one in the current layer pair
using the Place Via hotkey (V).

You can define the active pair along with a list of "preset" layer pairs
in the Set Layer Pair dialog, accessed from the two-color swatch on the
toolbar. These pairs are stored in the project file.

<img src="images/Pcbnew_layer_pair_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Pcbnew layer pair dialog" />

Each can be enabled or disabled, and given an optional user-friendly
name.

The enabled presets can be cycled using the Cycle Layer Pair Presets
hotkey (<span class="keycombo">Shift+V</span>). If the last-used or
current layer pair is not a preset, it is included in the list with the
name "Manual".

![Pcbnew layer pair cycle
dialog](images/Pcbnew_layer_pair_cycle_dialog.png)

### Placing free vias

In addition to [placing vias while routing](#placing-vias), you can also
place standalone vias. These vias connect to items that they touch when
they are placed. Free vias may be useful for via stitching, via
shielding, thermal design, or other reasons.

To place a free via, click the ![add via
24](images/icons/add_via_24.png) button or press
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+X</span>, then click in the desired
location in the editing canvas. If you place a via directly over a
track, it will connect to that track as if it was placed while routing:
it will take the track’s net, it will create a joint in the track, and
dragging the via will also drag the attached tracks.

The net assigned to a free via depends on where the via was placed. If
the via was placed over a track or pad, it will have the same net as the
track, and its **Automatically update via nets** setting will be enabled
so that its net changes with the track’s net. Otherwise, the via will
take the net of any zone under the via, if one exists, and its net will
not update automatically. If there are multiple zones under the via, you
will be prompted to choose which net to use. If there is no zone, the
via will not have a net assigned.

### Modifying tracks

After tracks have been routed, they can be modified by moving or
dragging, or deleted and re-routed. When a single track segment is
selected, the hotkey U can be used to expand the selection to all
connected track segments. The first press of U will select track
segments between the nearest junctions with pads or vias. The second
press of U will expand the selection again to include all track segments
connected to the selected track on all layers. Selecting tracks with
this technique can be used to quickly delete an entire routed net.

There are two different drag commands that can be used to reposition a
track segment. The Drag (45-degree mode) command, hotkey D, is used to
drag tracks using the router. If the router mode is set to Shove,
dragging with this command will shove nearby tracks. If the router mode
is set to Walk Around, dragging with this command will walk around or
stop at obstacles. Multiple tracks can be dragged at once using this
command. The Drag Free Angle command, hotkey G, is used to split a track
segment into two and drag the new corner to any location. Drag Free
Angle behaves like the Highlight Collisions router mode: obstacles will
not be avoided or shoved, only highlighted.

<div class="note">

Dragging of tracks containing arcs is not yet possible. Attempting to
drag these tracks will result in the arcs being removed in some cases.
It is possible to resize a particular arc by selecting it and using the
drag command (D). When resizing an arc using this command, no DRC
checking is performed.

</div>

The Move command (hotkey M) can also be used on track segments. This
command will pick up the selected track segments, ignoring any attached
track segments or vias that are not selected. No DRC checking is done
when moving tracks using the Move command.

It is also possible to move a footprint while keeping tracks attached to
the footprint as it moves. To do so, use the drag command (D) with one
or more footprints selected. Any tracks that end at one of the
footprint’s pads will be dragged along with the footprints. This feature
has some limitations: it only operates in Highlight Collisions mode, so
the tracks attached to footprints will not walk around obstacles or
shove nearby tracks out of the way. Any DRC violations caused by the
drag operation will be highlighted and will be prevent the footprint
drag from being committed when you click. To ignore the violations and
commit the drag anyway, use Ctrl+click. Additionally, only tracks that
end at the origin of the footprint’s pads will be dragged. Tracks that
simply pass through the pad or that end on the pad at a location other
than the origin will not be dragged.

To break a single track segment into two, use the Break tool (right
click a track → **Break Track**). The track will be broken into two
connected track segments at the cursor location. Each track segment can
then be selected, moved, and edited individually. To recombine the
segments into a single segment, drag the drack, or use the **merge
co-linear tracks** option in the [Cleanup Tracks and Vias
dialog](#cleaning-up-tracks-and-vias).

### Editing track and via properties

You can modify the width of tracks and the size of vias, without
re-routing them, in the properties dialog for the track or via. This
modifies all selected tracks and vias. The properties dialog shows the
relevant properties for the items in the selection: if both tracks and
vias are selected, then properties for both types of objects will be
displayed, but if only one type of object is selected then properties
for the other type of object will not be shown.

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_track_via_properties.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="pcbnew track via properties" />
</figure>

In the Common section, you can change the assigned net of the selected
objects using the **Net** dropdown. If the **Automatically update via
nets** option is checked, the selected vias cannot have their assigned
net manually changed, but instead will be assigned the net of any zone
or pad that they touch. You can also [lock](#locking) the selected
objects.

In the Tracks section, you can set the start and end position of the
tracks and the layer they are on. You can also change the track width,
either from a list of [pre-defined
sizes](#board-setup-pre-defined-sizes) or to an arbitrary value.

You can remove the solder mask from on top of tracks on outer layers by
enabling the **Solder mask** checkbox. When enabled, solder mask
openings will be drawn for each of the selected tracks with the same
shape as the source track. The **Expansion** textbox controls the size
of the mask opening relative to the original track: the expansion value
will be added to each side of the original track to form the mask shape.
For example, a 1mm wide track with a 1mm expansion would result in a 3mm
wide mask cutout, because the 1mm expansion is added to both sides of
the track.

In the Vias section you can change the properties of selected vias. You
can change the position of a via, the via’s type (through, micro, or
blind/buried), and which layers it spans. Through vias always start and
end on the front and back copper layers, but micro vias and blind/buried
vias can start and end ony any layers.

You can modify the via annulus and hole diameters, either from a list of
[pre-defined sizes](#board-setup-pre-defined-sizes) or to arbitrary
values. A via’s diameter and hole size can be defined on a per-layer
basis. This is also known as defining the via’s *padstack*. The
**Padstack mode** controls whether the via shape is the same on all
layers or whether individual layers are individually controlled.

- In the **Normal** padstack mode, the via’s diameter and hole size are
  the same on all layers.

- In the **Front/Inner/Back** padstack mode, the via’s diameter and hole
  size can be controlled separately for the front layer, the back layer,
  and the inner layers (the inner layers will have identical settings).
  The **Edit layer** dropdown controls which layer (or group of layers)
  is currently being displayed and edited.

- In the **Custom** padstack mode, the via’s diameter and hole size can
  be controlled completely independently on each layer. The **Edit
  layer** dropdown controls which layer is currently being displayed and
  edited.

The **Annular rings** setting controls which layers will have annular
rings for the via.

- When set to **All copper layers**, the via will have annular rings on
  every layer.

- When set to **Start, end, and connected layers**, the via will have
  annular rings on its start and end layers as well as any layer with a
  track or zone connection to the via. Any layer without track or zone
  connections, other than the start and end layers, will not have an
  annular ring.

- When set to **Connected layers only**, the via will have annular rings
  only on layers with a track or zone connection to the via. Any layer
  without track or zone connections will not have an annular ring.

Annular rings can be removed or added in bulk using the [Edit Track and
Via Properties dialog](#bulk-editing-tracks-and-vias) or by running the
[Unused Pads tool](#removing-unused-pads).

The **Front tenting** and **Back Tenting** options control whether the
via has front and back solder mask covering it.

- When set to **From design rules**, the tenting settings are taken from
  the Solder Mask/Paste panel in [Board Setup](#board-setup-stackup).

- When set to **Tented**, the via will be covered in solder mask,
  regardless of the settings in Board Setup.

- When set to **Not tented**, the via will not be covered with solder
  mask, regardless of the settings in Board Setup.

If the ![edit cmp symb links
16](images/icons/edit_cmp_symb_links_16.png) button is pressed, the
front and rear tenting settings will be linked. If it is unpressed, they
can be modified independently.

You can also change the [teardrop properties](#editing-teardrops) for
vias in this dialog.

<div class="note">

The properties of selected tracks and vias can also be modified using
the [Properties Manager](#editing-object-properties).

</div>

### Bulk editing tracks and vias

To modify tracks and vias in bulk you can use the Edit Track and Via
Properties dialog (**Edit** → **Edit Track & Via Properties…​**)..

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_edit_track_and_via_properties.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="pcbnew edit track and via properties" />
</figure>

**Scope** settings restrict the tool to editing only tracks, vias, or
both. If no scopes are selected, nothing will be edited.

**Filter Items** restricts the tool to editing particular objects in the
selected scope. Objects will only be modified if they match all enabled
and relevant filters (some filters do not apply to certain types of
objects. For example, via size filters do not apply to tracks). If no
filters are enabled, all objects in the selected scope will be modified.
For filters with a text box, wildcards are supported: `*` matches any
characters, and `?` matches any single character.

- **Filter items by net** filters to items assigned the specified net.

- **Filter items by netclass** filters to items assigned to the
  specified netclass.

- **Filter items by layer** filters to items on the specified board
  layer.

- **Filter tracks by width** filters to tracks with the specified track
  width.

- **Filter vias by size** filters to vias with the specified track
  width.

- **Selected items only** filters to the current selection.

Properties for filtered objects can be set to new values in the bottom
part of the dialog. Properties can be set to arbitrary values by
selecting **set to specified values** or set to the default value from
the net class (or custom rule) by selecting **set to net class / custom
rule values**.

When setting to specified values, you can choose `-- leave unchanged --`
to preserve objects' existing values, or select a new value from the
dropdown menu. For **Track width** and **Via size**, the options are the
[pre-defined track or via sizes](#board-setup-pre-defined-sizes) from
Board Setup.

### Removing unused pads

You can quickly remove unused annular rings from pads and vias using the
Unused Pads tool (**Tools** → **Remove Unused Pads…​**). This will leave
annular rings in place on layers where they are used and remove them on
layers where they are not used. An annular ring is considered unused if
there are no track or zone connections to the pad/via on that layer.

<figure>
<img src="images/unused_pads_tool.png" alt="unused pads tool" />
</figure>

The **Remove Unused Layers** button removes all unused annular rings
from pads and vias that meet the selected filter settings. The **Restore
All Layers** button restores all annular rings to the pads and vias that
meet the selected filter settings.

The checkboxes filter which objects will be modified (annular rings
removed or restored) and which layers will be removed for those objects.

- If the **Vias** checkbox is enabled, annular rings for vias will be
  modified.

- If the **Pads** checkbox is enabled, annular rings for pads will be
  modified.

- If the **Selected only** checkbox is enabled, only selected vias and
  pads will have their annular rings modified. If it is disabled,
  annular rings for all vias and pads will be modified. This setting
  applies in combination with the **Vias** and **Pads** checkboxes; for
  example, a selected via will not be modified if the **Via** checkbox
  is disabled.

- If the **Keep outside layers** checkbox is enabled, the pad or via’s
  start and end layers will remain, even if they are unused.

### Cleaning up tracks and vias

There is a dedicated tool for performing common cleanup operations on
tracks and vias, which is run via **Tools** → **Cleanup Tracks &
Vias…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_cleanup_tracks_and_vias.png"
alt="Cleanup Tracks and Vias dialog" />
</figure>

The following cleanup actions are available and will be performed when
selected:

- **Refill zones before and after cleanup:** refills all zones both
  before and after the cleanup operation. If unchecked, zone fills will
  not be changed.

- **Delete tracks connecting different nets:** removes any track
  segments that short multiple nets.

- **Delete redundant vias:** remove vias that are redundant because they
  are located on top of another via or on top of a through hole pad.

- **Delete vias connected on only one layer:** removes vias that are
  only connected to copper on a single layer and are therefore
  unnecessary.

- **Merge co-linear tracks:** merges any track segments that are
  connected and co-linear into a single equivalent track segment.

- **Delete tracks unconnected at one end:** removes track segments that
  have at least one dangling end.

- **Delete tracks fully inside pads:** removes tracks that have both
  start and end points within a pad and are therefore unnecessary.

You can also filter the objects that will be cleaned up by net,
netclass, layer, or selection.

- **Filter items by net:** limits the cleanup to tracks and vias
  assigned to the specified net.

- **Filter items by netclass:** limits the cleanup to tracks and vias in
  the specified netclass.

- **Filter items by layer:** limits the cleanup to tracks and vias on
  the specified layer.

- **Selected items only:** limits the cleanup to just the selected
  tracks and vias.

Any changes that will be applied to the board are displayed at the
bottom of the dialog after clicking the **Build Changes** button. After
building the changes, the button changes to say **Update PCB**. The
changes are not applied until you press the **Update PCB** button.

### Routing Convenience Functions

KiCad offers several functions to make certain routing operations more
convenient.

If you need to route a number of tracks from a set of pads, you can use
the Route Selected tool to quickly route from each pad in sequence.
Select the pads you want to use as starting points, then right click and
choose **Route Selected** (<span class="keycombo">Shift+X</span>) to
route from each pad in sequence. The router will begin a track from the
first selected pad, which you can route as you would any other track.
When you complete the track, the router will automatically begin a new
track from the next pad in the selection, in the same order that you
selected the pads. Pads that already have tracks attached are skipped.
You can also skip routing the current track and move on to the next pad
by pressing Esc. You can also select footprints instead of pads; all
unrouted pads in the selected footprints will be used as starting
points.

If you want to route a number of tracks *to* a set of pads, instead of
*from* the pads, you can use the Route Selected From Other End tool.
Select the pads you want to use as ending points, then right click and
choose **Route Selected From Other End**
(<span class="keycombo">Shift+E</span>). This tool works the same way as
the Route Selected tool, except it uses each selected pad as an end
point rather than a starting point. The starting point for each track is
the other end of the ratsnest line for each selected pad.

Routing from the other end is also possible while routing individual
tracks: press <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+E</span> while routing a track
to commit the current segment and begin routing from the other end of
the in-progress track’s ratsnest line.

Finally, you can quickly unroute tracks connected to an object
(footprint, pad, or track) by selecting the object, right-clicking, and
choosing **Unroute Selected**. Any tracks connected to the selected
object will be removed, starting at the selected object and continuing
until another pad is encountered.

### Automatically completing tracks

KiCad’s router can automatically route individual tracks, based on the
connections defined in the schematic. This can be thought of as a
limited form of auto-routing that considers a single track at a time.
The router will only use the current layer; it will not use vias or
change layers.

While routing, press the F key to have the router attempt to
automatically finish the current track. The track will be automatically
routed from the end of the last fixed track segment to the closest
ratsnest anchor. If the router can’t automatically finish the track, it
will allow you to complete the track manually. This action can also be
performed by clicking **Attempt Finish** in the context menu while
routing.

When the router is not the active tool, you can automatically route
multiple tracks by selecting footprints, pads, and tracks to route from,
right clicking, and choosing **Attempt Finish Selected (Autoroute)**
(<span class="keycombo">Shift+F</span>). You do not need to select both
ends of a desired connection; the router will route from the selected
item to its nearest ratsnest anchor. If multiple items were selected,
each item will be routed in sequence, in the order that they were
selected. If a connection cannot be automatically completed, the tool
will pause with the router active so that you can complete the track
manually. With the automatic completion paused for a manual connection,
you can press Esc to skip routing the current track. After manually
completing the track or skipping the connection, the tool will continue
attempting to route the remaining connections.

### Routing differential pairs

Differential pairs in KiCad are defined as nets with a common *base
name* and a positive and negative suffix. KiCad supports using `+` and
`-`, or `P` and `N` as the suffix. For example, the nets `USB+` and
`USB-` form a differential pair, as do the nets `USB_P` and `USB_N`. In
the first example, the base name is `USB`, and `USB_` in the second. The
suffix styles cannot be mixed: the nets `USB+` and `USB_N` do not form a
differential pair. Make sure you name your differential pair nets
accordingly in the schematic in order to allow use of the differential
pair router in the PCB editor.

To route a differential pair, click the Route Differential Pairs ![ps
diff pair 24](images/icons/ps_diff_pair_24.png) icon (from the drawing
toolbar or from the top toolbar under **Route**) or use the hotkey 6.
Click on a pad, via, or the end of an existing differential pair track
to start routing. You can start routing from either the positive or
negative net of a differential pair.

The differential pair router will attempt to route the pair of tracks
with a gap taken from the design rules (differential pair gap can be
configured in the Net Classes section of the Board Setup dialog, or by
using custom design rules). If the starting or ending location of the
route is a different distance apart from the configured gap, the router
will create a short "fan out" section to minimize the length of track
where the differential pair is not coupled.

When switching layers or using the Place Via (V) action, the
differential pair router will create two vias next to each other. These
vias will be placed as close as possible to each other while respecting
the design rules for copper and hole-to-hole clearance.

### Length tuning

The length tuning tools can be used to add serpentine tuning shapes to
tracks after routing. Length tuning shapes are persistent objects that
can be modified after they are created. To tune the length of a track,
first pick the appropriate tool.

- The single-track length tuning tool (icon ![ps tune length
  24](images/icons/ps_tune_length_24.png) or hotkey 7) will add
  serpentine shapes to bring the length of a single track up to the
  target value.

- The differential pair length tuning tool (icon ![ps diff pair tune
  length 24](images/icons/ps_diff_pair_tune_length_24.png) or hotkey 8)
  will do the same for a differential pair.

- The differential pair skew tuning tool (icon ![ps diff pair tune phase
  24](images/icons/ps_diff_pair_tune_phase_24.png) or hotkey 9) will add
  length to the shorter member of a differential pair in order to
  eliminate skew (phase difference) between the positive and negative
  sides of the pair.

As with the Routing icons, the Tuning icons are found in both the
**Route** menu dropdown from the top toolbar and the drawing toolbar on
the right.

When a tuning tool is active, you can hover over tracks in the board to
show a status window that displays their current length or skew as well
as the target values. Click on the desired track to start tuning it. As
you move the mouse cursor along the track, meander shapes will be added
interactively. If a target length has been set, meanders will stop being
added when the target length is reached. You can set a target length
with custom DRC rules or in the tuning shape properties; both methods
are explained below. The popup window next to the cursor shows a live
measure of the length or skew compared to the design targets. You can
adjust the spacing (1 to increase and 2 to decrease) and amplitude (3 to
increase and 4 to decrease) while you tune. When you are done, click
again to commit the tuned shape. The tuned track doesn’t need to be
perfect because you can adjust the shape after committing it. You can
also place multiple tuning shapes on the same track.

<div class="note">

The length tuning tools only support tuning the length of point-to-point
nets between two pads. Tuning the length of nets with different
topologies is not supported.

</div>

<div class="note">

Differential pair length tuning can only be applied to the coupled
portions of differential pairs. To apply length tuning to the uncoupled
portions of differential pairs, you must use single-track length tuner.

</div>

#### Editing tuning patterns

After a tuning pattern has been added, it can be selected, modified, and
moved. While it is selected, the target length and routed length are
shown in the message panel at the bottom left of the window.

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_tuning_pattern.png" alt="A tuning pattern" />
</figure>

When a pattern is selected, editing handles appear, which let you adjust
the pattern geometry.

- Dragging the handles at the ends of the pattern will expand or
  contract the pattern along the track.

- Dragging the corner handle towards or away from the track will
  respectively decrease or increase the maximum meander amplitude.

- The final handle controls the meander spacing; dragging it towards the
  corner handle will increase the spacing, while dragging it away from
  the corner handle will increase the spacing.

The selection box and editing handles represent the maximum allowable
extents of the tuning pattern. Making the box smaller will reduce the
size of the tuning pattern, even if this results in the tuned track
being shorter than the target length. When the box is enlarged, the
tuning pattern will expand to fill the box until the target length is
reached.

You can move a tuning pattern along its track by selecting it and
dragging with the mouse, or using the Move tool (M). Deleting a tuning
pattern (Del) removes the tuning pattern and restores the original
untuned tracks. You can also [ungroup](#groups) the tuning pattern,
which will decompose it into its component tracks. The basic tracks have
the same shape as the tuning pattern but can be edited individually.
Once ungrouped into tracks, a tuning pattern cannot be regrouped.

Another way to edit a tuning pattern is through its properties dialog.
The properties dialog exposes several additional parameters that can’t
be modified using the on-canvas interactive editor. These properties can
also be edited in the [Properties Manager](#editing-object-properties).

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_length_tuning_settings.png"
alt="pcbnew length tuning settings" />
</figure>

As with the interactive editor, you can set a maximum amplitude for the
tuning pattern and a spacing between meanders, but here you can set a
minimum amplitude and configure the corner style. Corners can be
**filleted** (rounded) or **chamfered**. In each case you can set the
**radius** as a percentage of the maximum possible radius for the
spacing and amplitude. You can also configure the tuning pattern to be
**single-sided**, which restricts it to one side of the baseline, as
opposed to the default style which positions meanders on both sides of
the baseline.

You can set default values for these properties in the **Design Rules**
→ **Length-tuning Patterns** page of the Board Setup dialog. Each type
of tuning pattern (single track length, differential pair length, and
differential pair skew) can have its own defaults.

Finally, the tuning pattern properties dialog is one of two ways to set
the target length or skew for a tuning pattern. Setting length targets
is explained below.

#### Setting target length and skew

There are two ways to set a target length or skew for a net:

- In the properties dialog for a tuning pattern that has already been
  added to a track.

- Using a custom DRC rule with the `length` and/or `skew` constraints.

The first method is to specify a target in the **target length** or
**target skew** field of the tuning pattern’s properties dialog. This
target will only apply to the selected tuning pattern. Therefore, length
targets set in this way must be set separately for each tuning pattern
in the design. The properties dialog for a tuning pattern is only
accessible after the pattern is initially created, so changing a target
length or skew in this way may require the pattern to be adjusted to
meet the new target value, if the pattern’s geometric constraints do not
allow sufficient space to meet the new target.

You can also set a target length and/or skew using [custom design
rules](#custom-design-rules). If custom rules are used, they will
override any targets set in tuning pattern properties, unless the
**override custom rules** checkbox is enabled in the tuning pattern
properties.

Using a custom rule allows you to set a net’s target length and/or skew
up front, before a pattern is created. With custom rules you can set
different length and skew targets based on specific criteria, such as
netclass or net name. You will also result in a DRC violation if the
net’s length or skew is out of bounds.

When target length or skew is adjusted in a custom DRC rule after a
pattern is created, the pattern geometry will not be automatically
updated to achieve the new target. You can use **Edit** → **Update All
Tuning Patterns** to recalculate all tuning patterns to meet the new
targets.

The following example custom rule sets a target length and skew for nets
in the `high_speed` netclass. The target length is 100mm, and a DRC
error will be raised if it is below 95mm or above 105mm. The target skew
is at most 0.1mm.

    (rule "target length and skew"
          (condition "A.hasNetclass('high_speed')")
          (constraint length (min 95mm) (opt 100mm) (max 105mm))
          (constraint skew (max 0.1mm)))

See the custom rule documentation for more details of how to create
rules that only apply to certain nets.

#### Length tuning pitfalls and tips

The length tuner only tunes nets with a point-to-point topology;
branching nets are not supported. When the length tuner encounters a
branch, it stops at the branch and only considers the length of the net
up to that branch.

Sometimes you may end up with leftover stub tracks somewhere in your
design. These can turn what appears to be a point-to-point net into a
branched topology, which will prevent length tuning from working as
expected. It may be easier to find such stub tracks when you switch
footprints, vias, and tracks to outline mode (![pad sketch
24](images/icons/pad_sketch_24.png), ![via sketch
24](images/icons/via_sketch_24.png), and ![showtrack
24](images/icons/showtrack_24.png) buttons, respectively). You can also
use the [track cleanup tool](#cleaning-up-tracks-and-vias) (**Tools** →
**Cleanup Tracks and Vias…​**) to remove many of these stubs
automatically.

By default, the length tuner includes vias in its length calculations.
Only the layer-to-layer length of the via is used, which may be shorter
than the full top-to-bottom via height if the tuned path is not
exclusively on the board top and bottom. The accuracy of this
calculation depends on the board stackup being accurately configured.
Via length can be ignored in length tuner calculations by deselecting
**include stackup height in track length calculations** in the
**Constraints** page of the [Board Setup
dialog](#board-setup-constraints).

The length tuner is optimized for adjusting the effective electrical
distance between two points, and therefore it calculates net length in a
slightly different way than other tools, such as the Net Inspector. In
addition to discounting net branches and unused portions of vias, the
length tuner also optimizes paths through pads to use the shortest
possible path in its calculations. In comparison, the Net Inspector
reports a simple summation of copper segment lengths. Both calculations
are accurate, but they are optimized for different purposes. These
differences are discussed in more detail in the [Net Inspector
documentation](#net-inspector).

### Teardrops

Teardrops are areas of extra copper that smooth the transition between
tracks and pads, vias, or other tracks with different width. Teardrops
are added to increase the mechanical robustness of a track connection.
They also reduce the risk of a misaligned drill hole disconnecting a
track from a drilled pad or via.

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_teardrop.png"
alt="teardrop on a through hole pad" />
</figure>

There are two ways to add teardrops to your design. You can add them in
bulk using the Edit Teardrops dialog, or you can add them to individual
pads and vias in the respective properties of the pad or via.

#### Adding teardrops in bulk

The Edit Teardrops dialog (**Edit** → **Edit Teardrops…​**) lets you add
teardrops to many board objects at once. The dialog has controls for
filtering which objects are affected and settings for configuring the
shape of the new teardrops. It also lets you edit or remove existing
teardrops.

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_edit_teardrops.png"
alt="Edit Teardrops dialog" />
</figure>

The **Scope** section controls which types of objects will be affected:
PTH pads, SMD pads, vias, and/or track-to-track connections. The
**Filter Items** section lets you filter objects by other criteria; you
can filter items by net, net class, and layer, or choose to act only on
round pads, pre-existing teardrops, or the objects in your selection.

The **Action** section controls whether to add or remove teardrops, as
well as the size and shape of the new teardrops.

**Remove Teardrops** will remove teardrops that match the scope and
filtering options at the top of the dialog. **Remove All Teardrops**
will remove all teardrops on the board, even if they do not match the
scope and filters.

**Add teardrops with default values for shape** will add teardrops with
the configured default teardrop settings to every board object that
matches the scope and filters. To configure the default teardrop
settings, click the **Edit default values in Board Setup** link or
manually open the **Teardrops** panel in [Board
Setup](#board-setup-teardrops). The defaults are configured separately
for teardrops connecting to round shapes, rectangular shapes, or between
tracks.

Instead of using the default values, you can provide custom teardrop
settings by selecting **Add teardrops with specified values**. The
available teardrop settings are:

- **Prefer zone connection:** if selected, a teardrop will not be
  created if the object is also connected to a zone.

- **Allow teardrops to span 2 track segments:** if selected, the
  teardrop will be able to spread over a second track segment if the
  first segment is too short to support a full teardrop.

- **Maximum track width:** a teardrop will not be created for a track
  connection that is wider than this percentage of the pad width
  (minimum pad dimension).

- **Best length:** the ideal length of the teardrop, as a percentage of
  the width (smallest dimension) of the attached object.

- **Maximum length:** the maximum length of the teardrop, as an absolute
  length.

- **Best width:** the ideal width of the teardrop, as a percentage of
  the width (smallest dimension) of the attached object.

- **Maximum width:** the maximum width of the teardrop, as an absolute
  width.

- **Curved edges:** if selected, the teardrop edges will be curved
  instead of a straight line.

Adding a teardrop to an object that already has a teardrop will update
the existing teardrop with the new settings. However, you can leave any
existing teardrop setting in an object unchanged by setting the value to
`-- leave unchanged --` in a textbox, or by selecting the third,
indeterminate state for a checkbox. Any value set this way will not be
updated in the targeted objects' teardrop settings.

#### Adding teardrops to individual objects

Rather than in bulk, you can add or edit teardrops for individual vias
in the properties dialog for that via, or for individual pads in the
**Connections** tab of the pad’s properties dialog. The settings in the
properties dialogs are the same as in the Edit Teardrops dialog. You can
also edit teardrops for individual pads and vias with the [Properties
Manager](#editing-object-properties).

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_pad_properties_teardrops.png"
alt="Pad Properties Connections settings" />
</figure>

#### Other details about teardrops

Teardrops in KiCad are small zones, meaning that when they refill they
avoid shorting to copper objects on other nets. They are initially
filled when they are added, but they are unfilled and refilled with
other zones on the board: when using the Unfill All Zones and Refill All
Zones commands, running DRC, generating fabrication outputs, etc.
Teardrops can be shown in filled or outline mode using the zone display
controls in the left toolbar.

Teardrops can be added to any type of pad, including custom pads. Some
custom pad shapes may produce undesirable teardrop shapes. In those
cases, it may be preferable to disable teardrop generation for those
specific pads.

## Graphics and text

Graphical objects (lines, arcs, rectangles, circles, polygons, text,
tables, and dimensions) can exist on any layer. They exist primarily for
aesthetics and documentation, although shapes on copper layers can make
electrical connections and have nets assigned.

### Graphical shapes

Graphical shapes are geometric objects that can be drawn on any board
layer.

When they are drawn on copper layers, graphical objects can be assigned
nets and make connections to other copper objects, much like tracks and
zones. There are differences between copper shapes and tracks or zones,
however:

- The shape of a graphical object is exactly defined by its own
  properties (size, position, line width, fill, etc.) and is not
  affected by other nearby objects. In contrast, a zone fills the area
  within a specified outline, but avoids different-net copper items to
  automatically maintain a specified clearance.

- Graphic lines and arcs are edited as simple shapes; the [interactive
  router](#routing-tracks) is not used for drawing or modifying them.
  Therefore collisions with other items are not detected interactively
  as they would be when routing tracks (although they will be detected
  by [DRC](#design-rule-checking)).

The buttons on the right toolbar can be used to create:

- Lines (![add line 24](images/icons/add_line_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+L</span>)

- Arcs (![add arc 24](images/icons/add_arc_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+A</span>)

- Bezier curves (![add bezier 24](images/icons/add_bezier_24.png),
  default hotkey <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+B</span>)

- Rectangles (![add rectangle 24](images/icons/add_rectangle_24.png))

- Circles (![add circle 24](images/icons/add_circle_24.png), default
  hotkey <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+C</span>)

- Polygons (![add graphical polygon
  24](images/icons/add_graphical_polygon_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+P</span>)

To place a shape, select the tool, then click in the canvas to place the
shape’s first point. Click again to place the shape’s second point. For
rectangles and circles, placing the second point will fully define the
shape and finish drawing it. Some shapes require three or more points to
be placed, however. Arcs require three points, while lines, polygons and
bezier curves can accept an arbitrary number of points, and require a
double click to complete.

To modify an existing graphical object, select it, then drag its editing
handles to change the shape. Moving a handle at the vertex of a shape
will move that vertex. Moving a handle on the edge of a shape will move
that edge while maintaining the edge’s angle.

Arcs have two vertex editing modes, which are selectable in
**Preferences** → **PCB Editor** → **Editing Options** or by right
clicking the ![add arc 24](images/icons/add_arc_24.png) button on the
right toolbar.

- The first mode (**keep arc center, adjust radius**) maintains the
  position of the arc center as as the arc endpoints or midpoint are
  dragged, changing the radius as necessary.

- The second mode (**keep arc endpoints or direction of starting
  point**) maintains the position of the arc endpoints and the arc’s
  direction of curvature as the midpoint or center are dragged.

Just like with tracks, you can expand a selection from one graphic line
to include all other contiguous graphic lines by pressing U.

The properties of a graphic shape can be adjusted in the shape’s
properties dialog or with the [Properties
Manager](#editing-object-properties).

<figure>
<img src="images/graphic_shape_properties.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="graphic shape properties" />
</figure>

- The top section contains controls for editing the object’s location
  and shape. Some types of objects can be edited in multiple ways, with
  each method in its own tab. For example, a line segment can be edited
  by its start and end points, by its start point, length, and angle, or
  by its start and mid points.

- **Locked** controls whether or not the text object is
  [locked](#locking). Locked objects may not be manipulated or moved,
  and cannot be selected unless the **Locked Items** option is enabled
  in the Selection Filter panel.

- Closed shapes (rectangles, circles, and polygons) can be outlines or
  filled shapes, which is controlled by the **Filled shape** checkbox.

- The **Line width** option controls the width of the outline, even for
  filled objects. The outline width extends on both sides of the "ideal"
  shape of the graphic object. For example, a graphic circle that is
  defined to have 2mm radius and 0.2mm line width will consist of a
  torus with an outer radius of 2.1mm and inner radius of 1.9mm. If the
  shape is filled and the line width is set to 0, the shape will be a
  filled circle with 2mm radius. Several line styles are available in
  the **Line style** dropdown: solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot, and
  dash-dot-dot.

<div class="note">

You can customize the default style of newly-created graphical shapes in
the Text & Graphics Defaults section of the Board Setup dialog.

</div>

- The **Layer** dropdown controls which layer the shape is placed on.
  Graphical shapes on copper layers can have a net assigned in their
  properties dialog. Copper shapes with a net make connections like
  tracks or zones. Unlike zones, copper graphical objects always
  maintain their shape and do not keep clearance to other copper
  objects.

- When shapes are placed on outer copper layers, they can be configured
  to affect the corresponding solder mask layer in addition to their
  primary copper layer by enabling the **Solder mask** checkbox. When
  enabled, a shape on the front copper layer will also be drawn on the
  front solder mask layer, while a back copper shape will also be drawn
  on the back solder mask layer. Because solder mask layers are
  negative, this will result in a solder mask opening with the same
  shape as the copper shape. The **Expansion** textbox controls the size
  of the mask opening relative to the original copper shape: the
  expansion value will be added to each side of the original shape to
  form the mask shape. For example, a 1mm wide copper segment with a 1mm
  expansion would result in a 3mm wide mask cutout, because the 1mm
  expansion is added to both sides of the segment.

#### Shape modification tools

KiCad has several tools for modifying combinations of graphic shapes in
useful ways, such as chamfering two lines or combining two polygons.
These tools are used by selecting the shapes you want to modify, right
clicking, and then choosing the relevant tool in the **Shape
Modification** submenu. Different tools are available for different
combinations of selected shapes.

- **Heal shapes** fixes a discontinuity between two lines or arcs. A new
  line segment is added to connect the ends of each shape together, up
  to a specified tolerance.

- **Fillet lines** adds an arc to round the corner between two connected
  lines with a specified radius. The two original lines are shortened to
  meet the endpoints of the arc.

- **Chamfer lines** adds a line segment to create a new edge between two
  connected lines with a specified setback. The two original lines are
  shortened to meet the endpoints of the new segment.

- **Dogbone corners** adds circular reliefs to the corners of the
  selected shapes. This is similar to filleting, but the modified shape
  is larger than the original, with the added arcs intersecting the
  vertices of the original corners. In other words, the added reliefs
  exactly enclose the original corners. This can be useful for relieving
  the corners of interior cutouts so that they can be manufactured using
  a round cutting tool. There is an option to **Add slots to acute
  corners**, which adds extended slots in corners that are too narrow to
  reach with a cutting tool of the selected radius.

- **Extend lines to meet** lengthens two selected lines until they
  intersect each other. The two lines will share a coincident endpoint.

- **Merge polygons** combines two or more selected polygons into one new
  polygon that is the union of the original shapes.

- **Subtract polygons** subtracts one or more polygons from another
  polygon, resulting in a new polygon that is the difference of the
  original shapes. The first-selected polygon(s) are subtracted from the
  last-selected polygon.

- **Intersect polygons** results in a new polygon that is the shape of
  the overlapping area between two or more selected polygons.

#### Converting objects to and from graphic shapes

KiCad provides tools to convert graphic objects to other types of
objects, other types of objects to graphic objects, and graphic objects
to other kinds of graphic objects. These tools are used by selecting the
shapes you want to convert, right clicking, and then choosing the
desired result object from the **Create From Selection** submenu. Most
types of object conversions have several conversion options that are
presented in a settings dialog. The exact options differ based on the
target object type.

When converting to a graphic polygon, rule area, or zone, there are
several options for how to convert the source objects into a polygonal
outline.

- If **copy line width of first object** is selected, an unfilled
  polygon will be created that has its line width taken from the line
  width of the first selected source object. This option is only
  available when converting to a graphic polygon, and the source object
  must be a closed shape.

- If **use centerlines** is selected, an object with zero line width
  will be created, with its outline placed at the centerlines of the
  source objects. The source object must be a closed shape. If the
  target object is a graphic polygon, it will be filled.

- If **create bounding hull** is selected, an object will be created
  with the specified **line width**. The object’s outline will be offset
  from the outermost extents of the source object by the specified
  **gap**. The source object does not need to be a closed shape when a
  bounding hull is created.

Most conversions provide a **delete source objects after conversion**
option, which will result in the original object being deleted during
the conversion, only leaving the new object in place. If this option is
not selected, the conversion will leave the original object in place in
addition to the new object. The original object will be selected
following the conversion so that it can be manually deleted by pressing
Delete.

<figure>
<img src="images/create_polygon_from_selection.png"
alt="create polygon from selection" />
</figure>

The following conversion types are available:

- **Create Polygon From Selection** converts a graphic shape, text,
  zone, rule area, or track into a polygon. This can be used to convert
  separate graphic shapes, such as lines and arcs, into a unified shape.
  It can also be used to convert a text object into a shape that can
  have its outline manipulated graphically.

- **Create Zone From Selection** converts a graphic shape, text, zone,
  rule area, or track into a zone. In addition to the conversion
  settings, the conversion dialog also shows options for [configuring
  the resulting zone](#working-with-zones). This can be used to create
  zone outlines with complex shapes, such as curves, that would
  otherwise be difficult to create using the zone tool.

- **Create Rule Area From Selection** converts a graphic shape, text,
  zone, rule area, or track into a rule area. In addition to the
  conversion settings, the conversion dialog also shows options for
  [configuring the resulting rule area](#pcb-rule-areas). This can be
  used to create rule area outlines with complex shapes, such as curves,
  that would otherwise be difficult to create using the rule area tool.

- **Create Lines From Selection** converts a graphic polygon or
  rectangle into graphic lines that follow the source shape’s outline.
  This can be used to convert a unified shape into its constituent
  outline segments.

- **Create Outsets From Selection** converts the selected object
  (graphic shapes, pads, etc.) into a rectangle that surrounds the
  original shape with some spacing. This can be used to quickly create
  outlines, courtyards, etc., especially in combination with other shape
  modification tools.

  - The **Outset** distance specifies the minimum distance between the
    outset and the original shape. There will always be at least this
    much space between the two shapes.

  - If **Round corners (when possible)** is enabled, the outset will
    have rounded corners rather than being a simple rectangle.

  - If **Round outwards to grid multiples (when possible)** is enabled,
    the outset will be placed on the specified grid, rounding outwards
    when necessary so that the specified outset distance is maintained.

  - If **Copy item layers** is enabled, the outset will be drawn on the
    same layer as the original shape. If disabled, the outset will be
    drawn on the layer selected in the dropdown menu.

  - If **Copy item thickness (when possible)** is enabled, the outset
    will be drawn with the original item’s thickness if that item has a
    thickness, or the specified thickness otherwise. Some source items,
    like pads, do not have a thickness property. The specified thickness
    will always be used when this option is disabled.

- **Create Tracks From Selection** converts a graphic shape, zone, or
  rule area into tracks that follow the source shape’s outline. If the
  source object is not on a copper layer, a dialog will be presented to
  specify the target copper layer. The source object is not removed
  following conversion, but remains selected so that it can be easily
  deleted if desired.

- **Create Arc From Selection** converts a graphic line segment or track
  segment into a graphic arc. The arc’s endpoints are placed at the
  endpoints of the source segment and its thickness is taken from the
  source object’s line thickness. The source segment is not removed
  following conversion, but remains selected so that it can be easily
  deleted if desired.

#### Importing vector graphics

You can add graphic shapes from an external vector graphics file by
importing the file into KiCad. DXF and SVG files are supported. To
import the file, use **File** → **Import** → **Graphics…​**
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+F</span>).

Imported vector graphics are part of the design like any other graphic
shape. In other words, they have an assigned board layer, they are
included in fabrication outputs, and shapes on copper layers can make
electrical connections.

<figure>
<img src="images/import_vector_graphics.png"
alt="import vector graphics" />
</figure>

The Import Vector Graphics File dialog has several options:

- **File** specifies the vector graphics file to import.

- **Import Scale** sets the scale factor for the import.

- **DXF default line width** sets the line width for any items in a DXF
  file that do not specify a line width. It has no effect when not
  importing DXF files.

- **DXF default units** sets the default unit for DXF files with
  unspecified units. It has no effect when not importing DXF files.

- If **Place At** is enabled, the imported shapes are placed at the
  specified location, relative to the PCB Editor’s [page
  origin](#grids-and-snapping). If it is disabled, the imported shapes
  are placed interactively.

- If **Layer** is enabled, the imported shapes are placed onto the
  selected layer. If it is disabled, the shapes are placed onto the
  active layer.

- If **Group imported items** is enabled, all shapes imported from the
  vector graphics file are added to a [group](#groups).

- If **Fix discontinuities** is enabled, any shape discontinuities
  smaller than the specified **tolerance** are filled by extending each
  segment until they intersect or adding an additional segment.

### Text objects

Graphical text may be placed by using the ![text
24](images/icons/text_24.png) button in the right toolbar or by keyboard
shortcut <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+T</span>. Activating the tool
brings up a text properties dialog. After configuring the text and its
properties and accepting the dialog, you can click in the canvas to
place the text.

You can also add text boxes, which are similar to regular text except
that they have an optional border and they automatically reflow text
within that border. Text boxes are placed with the ![add textbox
24](images/icons/add_textbox_24.png) button, and require clicking twice
to specify the top left and bottom right corners of the box.

<figure>
<img src="images/text_properties_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="text properties dialog" />
</figure>

- **Locked** controls whether or not the text object is
  [locked](#locking). Locked objects may not be manipulated or moved,
  and cannot be selected unless the **Locked Items** option is enabled
  in the Selection Filter panel.

- **Layer** controls the text’s layer. Text may be placed on any layer,
  but note that text on copper layers cannot be associated with a net
  and cannot form connections to tracks or pads. Copper zones will fill
  around the rectangular bounding box of text objects.

- There are several formatting options: text can be bolded, italicized,
  left/right/center aligned, top/bottom/center aligned, and reversed.

- The **knockout** option adds a solid rectangle surrounding the text
  and makes the text itself a negative cutout. This feature is only
  available for regular text objects, not text boxes.

- The **Font** dropdown lets you select a font for the text. You can use
  any TTF font available on your system, or the built-in KiCad stroke
  font.

<div class="note">

User fonts are not embedded by default in the project. If the project is
opened on another computer that does not have the selected font
installed, a different font will be substituted. You can optionally
embed into the board file any fonts used by the design in the
[**Embedded Files** section of Board Setup](#pcb-embedding-files). For
maximum compatibility without embedding, use the KiCad font. Also
consider converting text objects to polygons before sharing a project
(right click a text object → **Create from Selection** → **Create
Polygon from Selection…​**). Text converted to polygons is not editable
as text, but will render identically on any computer.

</div>

- You can adjust the text size with the **text width** and **text
  height** controls. When you are using the KiCad font, you can also
  adjust the stroke width with the **thickness** control. The **Update
  Thickness According to Text Size** button automatically sets the text
  thickness according to the text size: the thickness for normal text is
  set to the size divided by 8, and the thickness for bold text is set
  to the size divided by 5.

- **Position X** and **position Y** control the text object’s location.
  These properties are not available for text boxes.

- **Orientation** is the rotation angle of the text object. You can
  select an angle in 90 degree increments from the dropdown, or type in
  an arbitrary angle.

Text boxes additionally have options controlling their border.

- The **border** checkbox makes the border visible or invisible. For
  visible borders, you can adjust the border’s thickness with the
  **border width** control and the line style with the **border style**
  control (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot, or dash-dot-dot).

- The **margins** between the border and the text on each side of a text
  box can be set using the [Properties
  Manager](#editing-object-properties). Margins cannot be set in the
  Text Box Properties dialog.

<div class="note">

You can customize the default style of newly-created text objects in the
Text & Graphics Defaults section of the Board Setup dialog.

</div>

Finally, text supports markup for superscripts, subscripts, overbars,
evaluating project variables, and accessing symbol field values.

| Feature                                      | Markup Syntax        | Result                             |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Superscript                                  | `text^{superscript}` | text<sup>superscript</sup>         |
| Subscript                                    | `text_{subscript}`   | text<sub>subscript</sub>           |
| Overbar                                      | `~{text}`            | <span class="overline">text</span> |
| [Variables](#schematic-setup-text-variables) | `${variable}`        | *variable_value*                   |
| [Symbol Fields](#text-variables)             | `${refdes:field}`    | *field_value* of symbol *refdes*   |

<div class="note">

Variables must be defined in [Board Setup](#board-setup-text-variables)
before they can be used. There are also a number of [built-in text
variables](#text-variables).

</div>

### Tables

You can use a table to organize text in a tabular format. Tables have
customizable borders, cell sizes, and headers, and can be placed on any
layer.

<figure>
<img src="images/table.png" alt="table" />
</figure>

To place a table, use the ![table 24](images/icons/table_24.png) button
in the right toolbar. Click in the canvas to place the top left corner
of the table, then click again to place the bottom right corner of the
table and finish drawing the table. The bigger you draw the table, the
more rows and columns will be added by default, but rows and columns can
be added or deleted after the table is created.

#### Editing table properties

When you finish drawing a table, the Table Properties dialog appears.
You can also open the Table Properties dialog in several other ways:

- Select any cell in the table, right click, and select **Edit Table**
  (Ctrl + E)

- Select the entire table, right click, and select **Properties…​** (E).
  You can select the entire table with a drag selection or by selecting
  a single cell, then right clicking and selecting **Select Table**.

- Click the **Edit Table…​** button in the Table Cell Properties dialog.

<figure>
<img src="images/table_properties.png" alt="table properties" />
</figure>

This dialog lets you edit the properties of the entire table, including
the text in each cell and the separators between cells. To change the
formatting of text in a cell, edit the properties of individual cells,
instead of the properties for the entire table.

<div class="note">

The properties for a table can also be edited in the [Properties
Manager](#editing-object-properties) when the entire table is selected.

</div>

The left side of the dialog displays an editable grid of the entire
table. You can edit the contents of any cell by clicking on the cell in
the grid. You can also edit the text in a cell by selecting the cell and
using the Properties Manager.

<div class="note">

Text in table cells supports the markup described in the [text objects
section](#text-objects) (superscripts, subscripts, strikethroughs,
etc.).

</div>

The right side of the dialog contains formatting options for the table.

- The **Layer** dropdown controls which board layer the table is on.

- The **Locked** checkbox controls whether or not the table is
  [locked](#locking). Locked objects may not be manipulated or moved,
  and cannot be selected unless the **Locked Items** option is enabled
  in the Selection Filter panel.

- The **External border** and **Header border** checkboxes control
  whether there is a border drawn around the entire table and the cells
  in the top row, respectively. When **Header border** is enabled, the
  border below the cells in the top row is styled using these external
  border settings rather than the row/column line settings. The line
  width of the header borders is controlled by the **Width** field. The
  line style can be set to solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot, or
  dash-dot-dot using the **Style** dropdown menu.

- The **Row Lines** and **Column lines** checkboxes enable horizontal
  lines between rows and vertical lines between columns, respectively.
  These have the same formatting options as the external and header
  borders.

#### Editing table cell properties

Instead of editing the properties of an entire table, you can also edit
the properties of individual cells. This modifies selected cells, but
does not affect other cells. To open the Table Cell Properties dialog,
double click on a cell, or select a cell, right click, and choose
**Properties…​** (E). If you select multiple cells, the properties dialog
will act on all of them at once.

<div class="note">

You can select multiple cells by clicking and dragging.

</div>

<div class="note">

To select all cells in a row or column, select a cell in that row or
column, right click, and choose **Select Row(s)** or **Select
Column(s)**. You can select multiple rows or columns in this way by
starting with multiple cells selected.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/table_cell_properties.png"
alt="table cell properties" />
</figure>

This dialog contains formatting options for the text in each cell.

- **Horizontal alignment** and **Vertical alignment** control how text
  is positioned within the cell.

- **Font** controls the text font used in the cell.

- The **Bold** and **Italic** checkboxes bold and italicize the text,
  respectively. These are three-state checkboxes, which can be set to
  off, on, or no change. No change is useful when multiple cells with
  different bold/italic settings are being edited at the same time.

- The **Text width**, **Text height**, and **Thickness** control the
  size and thickness of the text. **Thickness** only has an effect when
  the font is set to the KiCad Font.

- The **Cell margins** textboxes control the amount of spacing around
  the top, bottom, left, and right of the text in the cell.

You can click the **Edit Table…​** button to open the properties dialog
for the entire table.

<div class="note">

The properties for a table cell can also be edited in the [Properties
Manager](#editing-object-properties) when one or more table cells is
selected.

</div>

#### Editing table layout

The layout of a table (size and number of columns and rows) is initially
set when you create a table, but you can also edit the layout after
creation.

To resize a row or column, select a cell in that row or column, then
drag the handle on the right (to change the column width) or the bottom
(to change the row height) to the desired size.

To add rows or columns, select a cell next to where the new row or
column should go, right click, then choose **Add Row Above**, **Add Row
Below**, **Add Column Before**, or **Add Column After**, as desired.

To delete rows or columns, select a cell in the row or column you want
to delete, then right click and choose **Delete Row(s)** or **Delete
Column(s)**. To delete multiple rows or columns, start with a selection
that spans all the rows or columns you want to delete.

You can merge multiple cells into a single cell by selecting all the
cells you want to merge, right clicking, and choosing **Merge Cells**.
To unmerge them, select the merged cell, right click, and choose
**Unmerge Cells**.

### Dimensions

Dimensions are graphical objects used to show a measurement or other
marking on a board design. They may be added on any drawing layer, but
are normally added to one of the User layers. KiCad currently supports
five different types of dimension: aligned, orthogonal, center, radial,
and leader.

- **Aligned** dimensions (![add aligned dimension
  24](images/icons/add_aligned_dimension_24.png)) show a measurement of
  distance between two points. The measurement axis is the line that
  connects those two points, and the dimension graphics are kept
  parallel to that axis.

- **Orthogonal** dimensions (![add orthogonal dimension
  24](images/icons/add_orthogonal_dimension_24.png)) also measure the
  distance between two points, but the measurement axis is either the X
  or Y axis. In other words, these dimensions show the horizontal or
  vertical component of the distance between two points. When creating
  orthogonal dimensions, you can select which axis to use as the
  measurement axis based on where you place the dimension after
  selecting the two points to measure.

- **Center** dimensions (![add center dimension
  24](images/icons/add_center_dimension_24.png)) create a cross mark to
  indicate a point or the center of a circle or arc.

- **Radial** dimensions (![add radial dimension
  24](images/icons/add_radial_dimension_24.png)) show a measurement
  between a center point and the outside of a circle or arc. The center
  point is indicated by a cross.

- **Leader** dimensions (![add leader
  24](images/icons/add_leader_24.png)) create an arrow with a leader
  line connected to a text field. This text field can contain any text,
  and an optional circular or rectangular frame around the text. This
  type of dimension is often used to call attention to parts of the
  design for reference in fabrication notes.

<figure>
<img src="images/dimensions.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="dimensions" />
</figure>

After creating a dimension, its properties may be edited (hotkey E) to
change the format of the displayed number and the style of the text and
graphic lines.

<div class="note">

You can customize the default style of newly-created dimension objects
in the Text & Graphics Defaults section of the Board Setup dialog.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/dimensions_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="dimensions dialog" />
</figure>

#### Dimension format options

- **Override value:** When enabled, you may enter a measurement value
  directly into the **Value** field that will be used instead of the
  actual measured value.

- **Prefix:** Any text entered here will be shown before the measurement
  value.

- **Suffix:** Any text entered here will be shown after the measurement
  value.

- **Layer:** Selects which layer the dimension object exists on.

- **Units:** Selects which units to display the measured value in.
  **Automatic** units will result in the dimension units changing when
  the display units of the board editor are changed.

- **Units format:** Select from several built-in styles of unit display.

- **Precision:** Select how many digits of precision to display.

- **Arrow direction:** Select whether the dimension object’s arrow(s)
  point inwards towards the value text or outwards away from the text.
  The arrow direction can also be set while drawing a dimension by right
  clicking and selecting **Switch Dimension Arrows**.

- **Suppress trailing zeroes:** Select whether to hide trailing zeroes
  in the value text.

#### Dimension text options

Most of the dimension text options are identical to those options
available for other graphical text objects (see the Graphical Objects
section above). Some specific options for dimension text are also
available:

- **Position mode:** Choose whether to position the dimension text
  manually, or to automatically keep it aligned with the dimension
  measurement lines.

- **Keep aligned with dimension:** When enabled, the orientation of the
  dimension text will be adjusted automatically to keep the text
  parallel with the measurement axis.

#### Dimension line options

- **Line thickness:** Sets the thickness of the graphical lines that
  make up a dimension’s shape.

- **Arrow length:** Sets the length of the arrow segments of the
  dimension’s shape. A negative arrow length reverses the arrow
  direction.

- **Extension line offset:** Sets the distance from the measurement
  point to the start of the extension lines.

- **Extension line overshoot:** Sets the distance from the dimension’s
  line to the end of the extension lines.

#### Leader options

Leader dimensions have unique options:

<figure>
<img src="images/dimensions_leader.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="dimensions leader" />
</figure>

- **Value:** Enter the text to show at the end of the leader line.

- **Text frame:** Select the desired border around the text (circle,
  rectangle, or none).

### Bulk editing text and graphics

Properties of text and graphics, including footprint fields and
dimensions, can be edited in bulk using the **Edit Text and Graphics
Properties** dialog (**Edit** → **Edit Text & Graphic Properties…​**).

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_edit_text_and_graphics_properties.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="pcbnew edit text and graphics properties" />
</figure>

#### Scope and Filters

**Scope** settings restrict the tool to editing only certain types of
objects. If no scopes are selected, nothing will be edited.

**Filters** restrict the tool to editing particular objects in the
selected scope. Objects will only be modified if they match all enabled
and relevant filters (some filters do not apply to certain types of
objects. For example, parent footprint filters do not apply to graphic
items and are ignored for the purpose of changing graphic properties).
If no filters are enabled, all objects in the selected scope will be
modified. For filters with a text box, wildcards are supported: `*`
matches any characters, and `?` matches any single character.

- **By layer** filters to items on the specified board layer.

- **By parent reference designator** filters to fields in the footprint
  with the specified reference designator.

- **By parent footprint library link** filters to fields in footprint
  with the specified library link (library and footprint name).

- **Selected items only** filters to the current selection.

#### Action

Properties for filtered objects can be set to new values in the bottom
part of the dialog. Properties can be set to arbitrary values by
selecting **set to specified values** or reset to their layer’s default
value by selecting **set to layer default values**.

Drop-down lists and text boxes can be set to `-- leave unchanged --` to
preserve existing values. Checkboxes can be checked or unchecked to
enable or disable a change, but can also be toggled to a third "leave
unchanged" state.

- All items can have their **layer** set.

- Graphic items can have their **line thickness** modified.

- Text properties that can be modified are **font**, **text width**,
  **text height**, **text thickness** (KiCad font only), emphasis
  (**bold** and **italic**), orientation (**keep upright**), and
  alignment (**center on footprint**). Footprint fields can also have
  their **visibility** set.

### Cleaning up graphics

There is a dedicated tool for performing common cleanup operations on
graphics, which is run via **Tools** → **Cleanup Graphics…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/cleanup_graphics.png" alt="cleanup graphics" />
</figure>

The following cleanup actions are available and will be performed when
selected:

- **Merge lines into rectangles:** combines individual graphic lines
  that together form a rectangle into a single rectangle shape object.

- **Delete redundant graphics:** deletes graphics objects that are
  duplicated or degenerate.

- **Fix discontinuities in board outlines:** modifies the existing board
  outline to fix any discontinuities that are within the specified
  tolerance.

Any changes that will be applied to the board are displayed at the
bottom of the dialog. They are not applied until you press the **Update
PCB** button.

### Sheet title block

The drawing sheet’s title block is edited with the Page Settings tool
(![Page Settings tool](images/icons/sheetset_24.png)). You can also open
this tool by double clicking on any part of the drawing sheet.

<figure>
<img src="images/page_settings.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Page settings dialog" />
</figure>

Each field in the title block can be edited, as well as the paper size
and orientation.

You can set the date to today’s or any other date by pressing the left
arrow button next to **Issue Date**. Note that the date listed in the
board title block is not automatically updated. It is only updated when
changed in this dialog.

A drawing sheet file can also be selected to replace the default drawing
sheet. When choosing a drawing sheet, you can enable the **Embed File**
checkbox in the file browser to embed the drawing sheet in the board
instead of referencing an external file. This means the board will
appear the same when it is opened on another computer that does not have
the drawing sheet file available at the same external file path. For
more information, see the [embedded files
documentation](#pcb-embedding-files).

<figure>
<img src="images/title_block.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Title block" />
</figure>

## Rule areas (keepouts)

Rule areas, also known as keepouts, are board regions that can have
specific DRC rules defined for them. Some basic rules are available that
will raise DRC errors if certain types of objects are within the bounds
of the rule area, but rule areas can also be used together with [custom
DRC rules](#custom-design-rules) to define complex DRC behavior that
only applies within the rule area. Rule areas are also used to define
channels for [multichannel layout](#multichannel).

You can add a rule area by clicking the ![add keepout area
24](images/icons/add_keepout_area_24.png) button on the right toolbar
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+K</span>). Click on the canvas to
place the first corner, which will show the Rule Area Properties dialog.
After configuring the rule area appropriately, press **OK** to continue
placing corners of the rule area. The rule area shape can be an
arbitrary polygon; click on the starting corner or double click to
finish placing the rule area.

<figure>
<img src="images/rule_area.png" alt="rule area" />
</figure>

The Rule Area Properties dialog has the following options:

- The **layers** list determines which layers the rule area applies to.
  The area only appears on these layers and the selected keepout rules
  only apply on these layers. At least one layer must be selected. By
  default, the active layer in the editing canvas is preselected in the
  rule area layer list.

- The **area name** field is optional and provides an identifier for the
  rule area. If it is provided, it is included in DRC violation messages
  to make them clearer. It can also be used in custom DRC rules to
  identify a particular rule area.

- The **locked** checkbox determines if the rule area should be
  [locked](#locking). As with other objects, rule areas can also be
  locked or unlocked after they are created.

- The **Keepouts** tab contains several basic rules to prevent various
  types of objects from being placed within the rule area. The basic
  rules can be configured to keep out tracks, vias, pads, zone fills,
  and/or footprints. If an object of one of the selected types is within
  the rule area, a DRC error will be raised. Additionally, zone fills
  will automatically avoid a rule area if the rule area is configured to
  keep out zones.

<div class="note">

Even with no basic rules selected, rule areas can still be used to
define specific areas in which to apply [custom DRC
rules](#custom-design-rules).

</div>

- The **Placement** tab contains settings for [multichannel
  layout](#multichannel), which are explained in that section.

- There are a few options for the **outline display** of the rule area.
  The area can be shown with a hatched outline, fully hatched throughout
  the area, or with just the outline with no hatching. The **outline
  hatch pitch** is also adjustable.

## Locking

Most objects can be locked through their properties dialogs, by using
the right-click context menu, or by using the Toggle Lock hotkey (L).
Locking an item makes it more difficult to select, move, or modify the
object, which can prevent unintended modifications. Locked objects
cannot be selected unless the **Locked items** checkbox is enabled in
the selection filter. Attempting to move locked items will result in a
warning dialog:

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_locked_items_dialog.png"
alt="pcbnew locked items dialog" />
</figure>

Selecting **Override Locks** in this dialog will allow moving the locked
items. Selecting **OK** will allow you to move any unlocked items in the
selection; leaving the locked items behind. Selecting **Do not show
again** will remember your choice for the rest of your session.

<div class="note">

You can forget this choice and re-enable the lock override prompt for
the current session by unchecking **Do not prompt for lock overrides for
this session** in the **Editing Options** panel of the PCB Editor
Preferences dialog.

</div>

Locked items are displayed with a colored shadow around them. This can
be customized in your color scheme.

<div class="note">

Locked objects can’t be selected unless the **Locked items** checkbox is
enabled in the [selection filter](#selection). By default, this checkbox
is disabled to exclude locked items from selection.

</div>

## Groups

Groups let you treat multiple objects as a single object for the
purposes of moving or rotating them. Each object in the group will
maintain its position relative to the other objects in the group. Groups
can also have a name, which is displayed in the editing canvas when the
group is selected.

<figure>
<img src="images/group.png" alt="group" />
</figure>

Most types of objects in the Board Editor can be grouped: footprints,
tracks, zones, graphic items, and even other groups. Groups can contain
multiple different types of objects at once.

To add objects to a group, select them, then right click and choose
**Grouping** → **Group Items**. To remove all items from a group, select
the group, right click, and choose **Grouping** → **Ungroup Items**.

Once objects have been added to a group, selecting any of the objects
will select the group as a whole instead of the constituent objects. To
edit a specific object within a group, first select the group, the right
click and choose **Enter Group**. Double clicking on a group also enters
the group. When a group has been entered, objects within the group can
be selected and edited individually without affecting the other objects
in the group. To leave the group and stop editing its members
individually, right click and select **Leave Group**, select an object
outside the group, or use Esc.

There are several ways to modify which objects belong to a group. To
remove objects from an existing group, enter the group, then select the
objects you want to remove, right click, and choose **Grouping** →
**Remove Items**. To add items to a group, first ungroup all the items
from the group. This will leave the group’s former members selected.
Then add the new item to the selection and group the selection. Note
that without first ungrouping, this process would create a nested group:
a new group containing the new item and the entire original group, not
just the items in the original group.

You can also add or remove objects from a group in the group’s
properties dialog. To open a group’s properties dialog, press E or right
click and click **Properties…​**. The properties dialog lists the objects
contained in the group. To add an additional object to the group, click
the ![small plus 16](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) button, then click
on the desired object in the editing canvas. The object you click on
will be added to the group. To remove an object, select it in the list,
then click the ![small trash 16](images/icons/small_trash_16.png)
button.

<figure>
<img src="images/group_properties.png" alt="group properties" />
</figure>

The group properties dialog also lets you specify a name for the group
or [lock](#locking) the group. Groups can also be named or locked using
the [Properties Manager](#editing-object-properties).

## Aligning objects

The align tool moves a selection of objects so that they are all aligned
with a reference object. There are six different alignments to choose
from, depending on which part of the objects you wish to align. Objects
can be horizontally aligned by their left, center, or right edges, or
they can be vertically aligned by their top, center, or bottom edges.
Objects are only moved in one dimension, so objects stay in the same
horizontal position when aligned vertically, and vice versa. To align
objects by a given edge, select the objects, then right click and choose
**Align/Distribute** → **Align to Left** (or another alignment as
desired).

If the cursor is over an object in the selection, that object is used as
the reference object. Otherwise, the reference object is the object in
the selection which is located furthest in the alignment direction, for
example the leftmost object when aligning by left edge, or the topmost
object when aligning by top edge. The topmost object is used when
aligning by vertical center, and the leftmost when aligning by
horizontal center.

<figure>
<img src="images/align_before.png"
alt="Resistors before aligning to top" />
<figcaption>Before alignment</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/align_after.png"
alt="Resistors after aligning to top" />
<figcaption>After alignment</figcaption>
</figure>

In the example above, R1-R4 are vertically aligned by their top edges,
with R2 as the reference object. The first image shows them before
alignment and the second image shows them after alignment. In this case,
R2 is the topmost object before alignment, so it is chosen as the
reference object if the cursor is not over another resistor. After
alignment, the top edges of the resistors are at the same position, but
the horizontal positions of the resistors are unchanged.

## Distributing objects

You can use the distribute tool to move objects so they are evenly
spaced from each other (right click a selection → **Align/Distribute** →
**Distribute Horizontally** or **Distribute Vertically**). The two
outermost objects in the selection are not moved. This means the top and
bottom objects when distributing vertically, and the leftmost and
rightmost objects when distributing horizontally. The remaining objects
in the selection are evenly distributed between the outermost objects
and maintain their relative ordering. Objects are only moved in one
dimension, so objects stay in the same horizontal position when
distributed vertically, and vice versa.

<figure>
<img src="images/distribute_before.png"
alt="Resistors before distributing horizontally" />
<figcaption>Before distribution</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/distribute_after.png"
alt="Resistors after distributing horizontally" />
<figcaption>After distribution</figcaption>
</figure>

In the example above, R1-R4 are horizontally distributed. The first
image shows them before distribution and the second image shows them
after distribution. R1 and R4 are the leftmost and rightmost objects, so
they are not moved. R2 and R3 are moved so the horizontal spacing
between resistors is equal, but the vertical positions remain unchanged.
From left to right, R1-R4 are in the same order that they were in before
distribution.

## Arrays

KiCad has an array tool to create rectangular or circular arrays of
objects (footprints, vias, graphical objects, etc.). Two types of array
are possible: **Grid** and **Circular**.

<figure>
<img src="images/create_array_grid.png" alt="create array grid" />
</figure>

**Grid Arrays** are rectangular and are described by a **horizontal
count** and a **vertical count**, which set the number of columns and
rows in the array, respectively. The **horizontal** and **vertical
spacing** settings describe the distance between columns and rows, while
the **horizontal** and **vertical offset** settings describe a shift
applied to each row/column compared to the previous row/column.

You can create a repeating staggered pattern by choosing a **stagger**
setting, which controls the number of rows or columns that are offset
before the pattern repeats. You can stagger by **row** or by **column**.
For example, if two staggered rows are selected, each row will be
horizontally offset from the previous row by half of the array’s
horizontal spacing setting. Every other row will be placed at the
original spacing and offset. If three staggered columns are selected,
each column will be vertically offset by a third of the array’s vertical
spacing setting. Every third column will be placed at the original
spacing and offset. Offsets from the stagger settings are added to the
previous horizontal and vertical offset settings.

If the **grid position** option is set to **source items remain in
place**, the original items will not be moved, and the grid extends with
those items at one corner. If **center on source items** is chosen, the
grid is offset so that the resulting grid is centered where the items
used to be.

<figure>
<img src="images/create_array_circular.png"
alt="create array circular" />
</figure>

**Circular Arrays** are described by a center point, an angular spacing,
and, optionally, the number of arrayed items. If **set center by
position** is selected, the center point of the array will be defined by
the absolute X/Y position you enter in **center pos X** and **center pos
Y**. You can also interatively select a point from the board using
**Select Point…​**, or select the origin point of another item using
**Select Item…​**.

The **item count** field determines the number of objects in the array,
including the source object. The **angle** field determines the angular
spacing between items, with the center point at the center of the array.
Positive angles result in a counter-clockwise rotation relative to the
center point and the source item, while negative angles result in a
clockwise rotation. Select **full circle** to evenly space the entered
number of items around the circle.

When **rotate items** is selected, objects will be rotated around their
origins as array sweeps around the center point. Otherwise, objects will
maintain the same orientation as the source item.

When creating an array of footprints, whether rectangular or circular,
the **Footprint Annotation** settings control how the reference
designators will be set in the new footprints. This affects the linkage
of the new footprints to the schematic. If **keep existing reference
designators** is selected, the new footprints in the array will have the
same reference designators as the source footprints, resulting in
duplicated reference designators in the board. If **assign unique
reference designators** is selected, each new footprint created in the
array will have a unique reference designator automatically assigned.

<div class="note">

Creating an array of footprints will result in multiple copies of the
source footprint(s). If you are using a schematic-based workflow, this
will result in footprints that are not represented in the schematic, so
careful syncing between the board and the schematic will be needed.

</div>

## Multichannel layout

KiCad has a multichannel layout feature for easing designs that have
multiple repetitive subcircuits, like an audio mixer with many identical
channels. This feature lets you perform placement and routing for one
portion of a circuit, then automatically reuse that placement and
routing for the other repeated portions of the circuit.

<figure>
<img src="images/multichannel_layout.png" alt="multichannel layout" />
</figure>

Using the multichannel layout feature first requires you to designate
which portions of the schematic represent the repeated parts of the
circuit. You can either use [hierarchical
sheets](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#hierarchical-schematics), with a
repeated hierarchical sheet for each channel, or [component
classes](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#component-classes) with a unique
component class assigned to the symbols in each channel. Each channel
will exactly correspond to the symbols (and their associated
connections) in a single sheet or component class.

For the layout, specially configured [rule areas](#pcb-rule-areas) are
drawn on the board and used to describe the physical location of each
repeated channel. The automatic placement of footprints, routing, and
other items is restricted to these placement rule areas. Each "channel"
of the design corresponds to a single rule area. One rule area will be
the *reference* rule area, which will be manually placed and routed. The
other rule areas are the *target* rule areas, which will reuse the
placement and routing from the reference rule area.

After setting up the placement rule areas for each channel and manually
routing the reference channel, the Repeat Layout tool is used to copy
the placement and layout from the reference rule area to the target rule
areas.

<div class="note">

KiCad includes a demo project, called `multichannel`, that demonstrates
the use of the multichannel layout feature.

</div>

### Multichannel design procedure: schematic

Designing a multichannel layout begins in the schematic. You need to
specify which components (symbols) belong to each channel. Each channel
in the schematic must be equivalent to the other channels. This means
channels must match each other in the following ways:

- each matched channel needs to have the same number of symbols

- corresponding symbols in each channel need to have the same reference
  designator prefix (e.g. `R` or `U`), although the full reference
  designators need to be unique as usual

- corresponding symbols in each channel need to have the same footprint

- connections between symbols need to be equivalent in each channel

In the example schematic below, Channels 1, 2, 3, and 4 are equivalent
and therefore can be used to share routing in a multichannel design.
Even though the net connections are drawn differently in some channels,
the underlying net connections are the same. The different symbols in
Channel 2 and the different values in Channel 3 also do not break the
equivalency. Footprint assignments are not shown in the image, but the
symbols that correspond between channels must use the same footprints.
In this example, this means that R1, R3, R5, and R7 each must use the
same footprint, as must R2, R4, R6, and R8.

In contrast, Channels A and B are not equivalent to Channels 1-4, nor to
each other. Channel A contains an extra parallel resistor not present in
the other channels, and Channel B is missing a connection between the
two resistors.

<figure>
<img src="images/multichannel_equivalency.png"
alt="multichannel equivalency" />
</figure>

You can assign symbols to channels in two ways, either using
[hierarchical sheets](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#hierarchical-schematics)
or using [component
classes](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#component-classes).

- When doing a multichannel design using hierarchical sheets, each
  channel is represented by a different sheet. Normally you will
  instantiate the same hierarchical sheet file multiple times, with one
  instantiation per channel. Each sheet instantiation needs to include
  all of the symbols for the corresponding channel, with no extra
  symbols.

- When doing a multichannel design using component classes, each channel
  is represented by a different component class. Each component class
  needs to include all of the symbols for the corresponding channel,
  with no extra symbols. Component classes are shown in the previous
  schematic example.

### Multichannel design procedure: board

In the board, each channel is represented with a [rule
area](#pcb-rule-areas) with its rules configured for placement. You need
to add a rule area for each channel. One rule area is the *reference*,
containing manually placed and routed footprints. The other rule areas
are *targets* and have the reference placement and routing copied to
them. Placement rule areas, whether for reference or target channels,
need the following settings configured in their properties:

- The options in the **Placement** tab should be configured to select
  the hierarchical sheet or component class that contains the channel’s
  components.

- The options in the **Keepouts** tab should typically be unselected,
  unless there is a specific type of item that needs to be excluded from
  the rule area.

- The rule area’s **layers** should be set based on which layers are
  considered part of the channel. An item will be copied from the
  reference channel to a target channel only if the item’s layer is
  enabled in both the reference and target rule areas.

- The **area name** is used to label the rule area when it is listed in
  the Repeat Layout dialog. While not strictly required, it will be hard
  for you to distinguish rule areas in the GUI unless each rule area has
  a unique name.

<figure>
<img src="images/rule_area_placement.png" alt="rule area placement" />
</figure>

Placement rule areas can be manually created like any [rule
area](#pcb-rule-areas), or they can be automatically generated by
selecting **Tools** → **Multi-Channel** → **Generate Placement Rule
Areas…​**. This tool can draw basic placement rule areas for any of the
hierarchical sheets or component classes in the design, depending on
which you select.

<div class="note">

The tool allows you to generate a placement rule area for **any** sheet
or component class, even if it is not intended to represent a channel in
a multichannel design. It is your responsibility to select only the
desired sheets or component classes.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/multichannel_generate_rule_area.png"
alt="multichannel generate rule area" />
</figure>

The tool has several options:

- **Replace existing placement rule areas**: if enabled, the newly
  generated rule area for each channel will replace any rule areas that
  already exist for that channel.

- **Group footprints with their placement rule areas**: if enabled, the
  newly generated rule area for each channel will be added to a
  [group](#groups) with all footprints associated with that rule area.
  This allows the target rule area and its associated items to be
  manipulated as a single entity.

Automatically generated rule areas are preconfigured as placement rule
areas with the appropriate source hierarchical sheet or component class
selected. Their layers are set to just the front and back copper layers.
They are drawn as the minimum size rectangle that encloses their
constituent footprints, without extra space for routing or other items.
After generating a rule area, you may want to change the configured
layers to ensure all desired items in the reference channel get copied
to the target channels. You also may want to edit the shape of the rule
area, although rule areas for target channels will have their shapes
automatically adjusted to match the reference rule area.

<div class="note">

if generated rule areas are grouped with their footprints, you will need
to enter the group (or ungroup the items) in order to edit the rule
area.

</div>

Once you have created rule areas for each channel and completed placing
footprints and routing for the reference channel, you can use the Repeat
Layout tool to copy the reference channel’s layout to the other
channels. Run this tool using **Tools** → **Multi-Channel** → **Repeat
Layout…​**.

If a rule area is selected when the tool is run, that rule area will be
used as the reference rule area. If no rule area is selected, you will
be prompted to select a rule area. When the reference rule area is
determined, a dialog will appear.

<figure>
<img src="images/multichannel_repeat_layout.png"
alt="multichannel repeat layout" />
</figure>

The table at the top of the dialog controls which target rule areas will
receive the layout from the reference channel. Any target rule areas
that are not selected will not be updated. The tool will only copy items
to a target rule area if the target’s status is listed as "OK". If the
status is not "OK", the target channel’s circuit topology cannot be
matched to the reference channel; see the requirements for [how channels
need to match in the schematic](#multichannel-schematic) for more
information.

There are several options to control which items from the reference
channel are copied to the selected target areas, and how those copied
items are handled:

- **Copy footprint placement**: if enabled, the placement of footprints
  in the reference rule area will be replicated for footprints
  associated with the target rule area(s). Footprints are copied if they
  are enclosed by or intersect the reference rule area; they are not
  copied if they are fully outside. Footprints will only be copied if
  they are on a layer that is enabled in both the reference and target
  rule areas.

- **Copy routing**: if enabled, any tracks and vias in the reference
  rule area will be copied to the target rule area(s). Routing is copied
  if it is enclosed by or intersects the reference rule area; it is not
  copied if it is fully outside. Routing will only be copied if it is on
  a layer that is enabled in both the reference and target rule areas.

- **Copy other items**: if enabled, any other items (zones, graphic
  objects) fully enclosed by the reference rule area will be copied to
  the target rule area(s). Items are copied if they are fully enclosed
  by the reference rule area; they are not copied if they are partially
  or fully outside. This means, for example, that a large copper zone
  that intersects a reference channel will not be copied to the target
  channels. Items will only be replicated if they are on a layer that is
  enabled in both the reference and target rule areas.

- **Group items with their placement rule areas**: if enabled, the items
  copied to a target rule area will be added to a [group](#groups) with
  that rule area. This allows the target rule area and its associated
  items to be manipulated as a single entity.

- **Remove locked items from target rule areas**: if enabled, items
  associated with target rule areas will be updated even if they are
  [locked](#locking). If not enabled, locked items will not be updated
  to match the reference rule area.

After clicking **OK**, the layout from the reference channel will be
applied to the target channels. When the repeat layout is completed,
each channel can be individually edited like any other part of the board
design.

## Using reference images

KiCad supports displaying reference images in the canvas. These are
background images that you can use to help you lay out a board; they are
purely for reference during the design process and are not included in
any fabrication outputs.

To add a reference image, use the ![image 24](images/icons/image_24.png)
button on the right toolbar and select the desired reference image file.
Click in the canvas to place the image.

Once the image has been added to the canvas, you can reposition it using
the move tool (M) or by dragging it in the canvas. You can scale it by
dragging the editing handles at the corners of the image. The image is
scaled around its reference point; in other words, the reference point
is the point in the image that always stays in the same position in the
canvas, no matter how the image is scaled. The reference point is shown
as a fifth editing handle. Initially it is at the center of the image,
but you can reposition the reference point by dragging it in the canvas.

<figure>
<img src="images/reference_image.png" alt="reference image" />
</figure>

You can also reposition or scale the image in its properties dialog (E).
You can set the image’s exact **Position X** and **Y** in the
**General** tab, and set an exact **Scale** factor in the **Image** tab.
You can also **Convert to Greyscale** if you wish. Position and scale in
this dialog are relative to the center of the image, not its interactive
reference point.

Reference images have an associated board layer; they are shown and
hidden along with this layer. The layer initially associated with a
reference image is the layer that was active when the image was added.
You can change the associated layer in the image’s properties.

Another way to hide reference images is with the Appearance Manager. You
can show or hide all reference images by toggling the visibility of
**Image** objects in the **Objects** tab (![visibility
16](images/icons/visibility_16.png) button). You can also adjust the
opacity of reference images here.

# Forward and back annotation

Forward and back annotation are the processes for syncing schematic
changes to the board and syncing board changes to the schematic,
respectively.

## Update PCB From Schematic (forward annotation)

Use the Update PCB from Schematic tool to sync design information from
the Schematic Editor to the Board Editor. The tool can be accessed with
**Tools** → **Update PCB from Schematic** (F8) in both the schematic and
board editors. You can also use the ![Update PCB from Schematic
icon](images/icons/update_pcb_from_sch_24.png) icon in the top toolbar
of the Board Editor. This process is often called forward annotation.

<div class="note">

Update PCB from Schematic is the preferred way to transfer design
information from the schematic to the PCB. In older versions of KiCad,
the equivalent process was to export a netlist from the Schematic Editor
and import it into the Board Editor. It is no longer necessary to use a
netlist file.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/update_pcb_from_schematic.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Update PCB from schematic" />
</figure>

The tool adds the footprint for each symbol to the board and transfers
updated schematic information to the board. In particular, the board’s
net connections are updated to match the schematic.

The changes that will be made to the PCB are listed in the *Changes To
Be Applied* pane. The PCB is not modified until you click the **Update
PCB** button.

You can show or hide different types of messages using the checkboxes at
the bottom of the window. A report of the changes can be saved to a file
using the **Save…​** button.

### Options

### Re-linking symbols and footprints

Symbols and footprints are linked together using unique identifiers
(also called UUIDs). These are handled automatically within KiCad and
are not usually visible to users. They allow a symbol and its partner
footprint to keep their connection between schematic and PCB, even if
the reference designator is changed. New objects get assigned their
identifiers upon creation.

#### Re-linking by unique identifier (default)

In normal use, the **Re-link footprints to schematic symbols based on
their reference designators** option should be unchecked. In this mode,
symbols with the same identifier as a footprint will update that
footprint, regardless of the reference designator. Symbols which have an
identifier that doesn’t match any footprint will add a new footprint
linked to that identifier.

For example, in the below schematic, both `R1` and `R2` are linked via
their unique IDs to footprints on the PCB:

<figure>
<img src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_ID_link_before_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by unique identifier, before a change in reference designator" />
</figure>

If symbol reference designators are changed in the schematic (e.g. by
re-annotation), running the **Update PCB from Schematic** process will
update the reference designators on the PCB.

<figure>
<img src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_ID_link_after_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by unique identifier, after a change in reference designator" />
</figure>

#### Re-linking by reference designator

If the checkbox is checked, the linking process is done using the
reference designators. This can be useful for workflows that result in a
symbol being deleted and replaced by another one, rather than being
updated in-place. For example, cut-and-pasting a block of schematic or a
sheet and copy-pasting and re-annotating will usually break the
identifier-based links.

For example in the below case, the resistors `R1` and `R2` have been
deleted and replaced, then re-annotated. While the reference designators
are the same, the internal identifiers have changed. Updating the PCB by
identifier would cause the existing footprints to be deleted and new
ones added - to KiCad, the existing footprints have no matching symbol.
This would cause the footprints to lose their positions and need placing
again.

<figure>
<img
src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_RefDes_link_before_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by reference designator, after deleting and replacing symbols, but before updating the PCB" />
</figure>

Re-linking the footprints by reference designator causes KiCad to
re-create the links, using the matching reference designators as a
guide.

<figure>
<img
src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_RefDes_link_after_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by reference designator, after updating the PCB" />
</figure>

Because the links have been re-established, the next forward annotation
should use the normal identifier-based linking (i.e. the checkbox should
be unchecked).

## Update Schematic from PCB (back annotation)

The typical workflow in KiCad is to make changes in the schematic and
then sync the changes to the board using the Update PCB From Schematic
tool. However, the reverse process is also possible: design changes can
be made in the board and then synced back to the schematic using
**Tools** → **Update Schematic From PCB** in either the schematic or
board editors. This process is often called back annotation.

<figure>
<img src="images/update_schematic_from_pcb.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Update schematic from PCB" />
</figure>

The tool syncs changes in reference designators, values, footprint
assignments, and net names from the board to the schematic. Each type of
change can be individually enabled or disabled.

The changes that will be made to the schematic are listed in the
*Changes To Be Applied* pane. The schematic is not modified until you
click the **Update Schematic** button.

You can show or hide different types of messages using the checkboxes at
the bottom of the window. A report of the changes can be saved to a file
using the **Save…​** button.

<div class="note">

The [Geographical Reannotation](#geographical-re-annotation) feature can
be used in combination with backannotating reference designators to
reannotate all components in the design based on their location in the
layout.

</div>

### Back annotation with CMP files

Select changes can also be synced from the PCB back to the schematic by
exporting a CMP file from the PCB editor (**File** → **Export** →
**Footprint Association (.cmp) File…​**) and importing it in the
Schematic Editor (**File** → **Import** → **Footprint Assignments…​**).

<div class="note">

This method can only sync changes made to footprint assignments and
footprint fields. It is recommended to use the Update Schematic from PCB

## Geographical re-annotation

The Geographical Reannotation tool lets you automatically set the
reference designators of footprints based on their physical location on
the board.

To run the Geographical Reannotation tool, use **Tools** →
**Geographical Reannotate…​**. This opens the geographical reannotation
dialog with options for how to perform the reannotation.

<figure>
<img src="images/geographical_reannotate_options.png"
alt="geographical reannotate options" />
</figure>

The **Options** tab contains settings for how footprint locations affect
reannotation. The arrow diagrams indicate which geographical ordering to
use when reannotating. You can reannotate from left-to-right,
right-to-left, top-to-bottom, or bottom-to-top, and you can select
whether to use a column-major order (go through all footprints in the
same column before moving to the next column) or row-major order (go
through all footprints in the same row before moving to the next row).

Geographical reannotation can either use the location of the footprint
itself or the location of the footprint’s reference designator. You can
also select how much to round footprint locations before determining
which footprints are at the same X or Y position. Rounding to a finer
coordinate resolution will result in fewer footprints considered to be
in the same row or column.

Finally, you can select which footprints to reannotate. You can
reannotate all footprints on the board, all footprints on the front or
back of the board, or all footprints in your selection.

<figure>
<img src="images/geographical_reannotate_reference_designators.png"
alt="geographical reannotate reference designators" />
</figure>

The **Reference Designators** tab contains options for how to allocate
new reference designators. There are separate settings for footprints on
the front and back of the board.

**Reference start** controls the number for the first new reference
designator on each side of the board. If no start value is given for the
back of the board, back side footprints will be annotated starting at
one higher than the last front side reference designator.

**Prefix** specifies a prefix string to insert at the beginning of each
newly assigned reference designator. This prefix will be inserted before
any prefix that is already present. If the **remove prefix** option is
selected, footprints with the specified prefix will instead have that
prefix removed instead of added. Footprints without that prefix will not
have not have any prefix added or removed.

If **exclude locked footprints** is checked, locked footprints will not
be reannotated. You can also avoid reannotating specific footprints by
entering their reference designators as a comma-separated list in the
**exclude references** box.

When you click the **Reannotate PCB** button, footprints will be
reannotated according to the selected settings.

<div class="note">

The Geographical Reannotation tool updates reference designators in the
board, but not in the schematic. After geographically reannotating the
board, be sure to sync the updated reference designators to the
schematic by running the [Update Schematic from
PCB](#forward-and-back-annotation) tool with the **re-link footprints to
schematic symbols based on their reference designators** option
disabled. If the schematic is not updated, reference designators in the
board will not match those in the schematic.

</div>

# Inspecting a board

## Design rules checking

The Design Rules Checker (DRC) tool is used to verify that the PCB meets
all the requirements established in the Board Setup dialog and that all
pads are connected according to the netlist or schematic. KiCad can
automatically prevent some design rule violations while routing tracks,
but many others cannot be prevented automatically. This means it is
important to use the design rule checker before creating manufacturing
files for a PCB.

To use the design rule checker, click the ![erc
24](images/icons/erc_24.png) icon in the top toolbar, or select **Design
Rules Checker** from the **Inspect** menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/drc_control.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="drc control" />
</figure>

The top section of the DRC Control window contains some options that
control the design rule checker:

**Refill all zones before performing DRC:** when enabled, zones will be
refilled every time the design rule checker is run. Disabling this
option may result in incorrect DRC results if zones have not been
refilled manually.

**Report all errors for each track:** when enabled, all clearance errors
will be reported for each track segment. When disabled, only the first
error will be reported. Enabling this option will result in the design
rule checker running more slowly.

**Test for parity between PCB and schematic:** when enabled, the design
rule checker will test for differences between the schematic and PCB in
addition to testing the PCB design rules. This option has no effect when
running the PCB editor in standalone mode.

After running DRC, any violations will be shown in the center part of
the DRC window. Rule violations, unconnected items, and differences
between the schematic and the PCB are shown in three different tabs. A
list of the ignored tests is shown in the fourth tab. A report file in
plain text format can be created after running DRC using the **Save…​**
button.

<figure>
<img src="images/drc_violations.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="drc violations" />
</figure>

Each violation involves one or more objects on the PCB. In the list of
violations, the objects involved are listed below the violation.
Clicking on the violation in the list view will move the PCB Editor view
so that the affected area is centered. Clicking on one of the objects
involved in a violation will highlight the object.

Certain types of violations have contextual actions in the context menu.
For example, clearance violations have an action to run the [clearance
resolution tool](#clearance-and-constraint-resolution) on the violating
items, while custom rule violations have an action to run the
[constraint resolution tool](#clearance-and-constraint-resolution). For
board vs. library footprint mismatch violations, there is an action to
run the [Compare Footprint with Library](#comparing-footprints) tool.
These actions can help to quickly identify the reason for a particular
violation.

The numbers at the bottom of the window show the number of errors,
warnings, and exclusions. Each type of violation can be filtered from
the list using the respective checkboxes. Clicking **Delete Marker**
will clear the selected violation until DRC is run again, while clicking
**Delete All Markers** will clear all violations until the next DRC run.

Violations can be right-clicked in the dialog to ignore them or change
their severity:

- **Exclude this violation:** ignores this particular violation, but
  does not affect any other violations. You can un-exclude a violation
  by right clicking the excluded violation and selecting **Remove
  exclusion for this violation**.

- **Exclude with comment…​:** the same as **Exclude this violation**, but
  prompts for a comment explaining the reason for the exclusion. When
  excluded violations are unhidden (using the **Exclusions** checkbox),
  exclusion comments are shown with the corresponding excluded
  violation. To edit an existing exclusion comment or add a comment to
  an existing exclusion, right click an excluded violation and select
  **Edit exclusion comment…​**.

- **Exclude all violations of rule:** the same as **Exclude this
  violation**, but excludes *all* violations caused by the same [custom
  DRC rule](#custom-design-rules). This action only appears in the
  context menu for violations caused by custom design rules. If you
  right click on a custom design rule violation that is already
  excluded, you can instead **Remove all exclusions for violations of
  rule**.

- **Change severity:** changes a type of violation from warning to
  error, or error to warning. This affects all violations of a given
  type.

- **Ignore all:** ignores all violations of a given type. This test will
  now appear in the **Ignored Tests** tab rather than the **Violations**
  tab. You can un-ignore the test again by right clicking the test in
  the **Ignored Tests** tab, or in the [Violation Severity
  panel](#board-setup-violation-severity) in Board Setup.

- **Edit violation severities…​:** opens the [Violation Severity
  panel](#board-setup-violation-severity) in Board Setup, for editing
  the severities of all DRC violation types.

Excluded and ignored violations are remembered between runs of the
design rule checker. Excluded violations are hidden unless the
**Exclusions** checkbox is enabled. Ignored violations are not shown,
but there is a list of ignored tests in the **Ignored Tests** tab.

### Clearance and constraint resolution

The clearance and constraint resolution tools allow you to inspect which
clearance and design constraint rules apply to selected items. These
tools can help when designing PCBs with complex design rules where it is
not always clear which rules apply to an object.

To inspect the clearance rules that apply between two objects, select
both objects and choose **Clearance Resolution** from the **Inspect**
menu. The Clearance Report dialog will show the clearance required
between the objects on each copper layer, as well as the design rules
that resulted in that clearance.

<figure>
<img src="images/clearance_resolution.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="clearance resolution" />
</figure>

To inspect the design constraints that apply to an object, select it and
choose **Constraints Resolution** from the **Inspect** menu. The
Constraints Report dialog will show any constraints that apply to the
object.

<figure>
<img src="images/constraints_resolution.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="constraints resolution" />
</figure>

### DRC configuration

The severity of each DRC check can be configured in the **Violation
Severity** section of the [Board Setup
dialog](#board-setup-violation-severity). Each rule may be set to create
an error marker, a warning marker, or no marker (ignored).

<div class="note">

Individual rule violations may be ignored in the Design Rule Checker.
Setting a rule to Ignore in the Violation Severity section will
completely disable the corresponding design rule check. Use this setting
with caution.

</div>

<figure>

alt="board setup violation severity" />
</figure>

### List of DRC checks

The table below lists the design rules that KiCad checks and the default
violation severity for each check. All severities are configurable. Some
design are only available through [custom design
rules](#custom-design-rules).

#### Electrical DRC checks

These DRC checks look for gross electrical issues on the board such as
shorts and clearance violations.

### User-definable DRC violations

You can manually trigger board DRC warnings or errors using special
[text variables](#text-variables). These items will appear as errors or
warnings when DRC runs. This can be useful to flag items for later
followup or review.

To cause a DRC violation, use the text variable
`${DRC_ERROR <violation name>}` or `${DRC_WARNING <violation name>}`
depending on whether an error or warning is desired. You can place this
in a text item or text box on any board layer. When DRC runs, this will
generate a DRC violation with the given violation name. These text
variables resolve to an empty string in the board, and any text after
the braces is included in the DRC violation’s description. The text
variable must be placed at the start of the text object in order to
trigger a violation.

For example, a text item containing
`${DRC_ERROR TODO}Length match tracks` will appear in the board as just
the text "Length match tracks", and will generate a DRC error named
"TODO" with "Length matches tracks" in the description.

### DRC report file

An DRC report file can be generated and saved by clicking the **Save…​**
button in the DRC dialog. The file extension for DRC report files is
`.rpt`. An example DRC report file is given below.

    ** Drc report for pic_programmer.kicad_pcb **

## Board Statistics

The Board Statistics dialog shows a summary of the board’s contents,
including the size of the board and counts of various types of items.
Open the Board Statistics dialog with **Inspect** → **Show Board
Statistics**.

<figure>
<img src="images/Pcbnew_board_statistics.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Pcbnew board statistics" />
</figure>

The **General** tab gives counts of various types of objects:

- Footprints, separated by type (THT, SMD, or unspecified) and board
  side

- Pads, separated by type (THT, SMD, connector, or NPTH)

- Vias, separated by type (through, blind/buried, or micro)

It also displays the board width, height, and area.

The **Drill Holes** tab lists every unique type of drill hole on the
board. Each type of hole is listed with its characteristics (shape, X
and Y size, plating, pad or via type, and start and stop layers) and the
count of that type of hole.

You can save the board statistics to a file by clicking the **Generate
Report File…​** button.

## Measurement tool

The measurement tool allows you to make distance and angle measurements
between points on the PCB. To activate the tool, click the ![measurement
24](images/icons/measurement_24.png) icon in the right toolbar, or use
the hotkey <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+M</span>. Once the tool is
active, click once to set the measurement start point, then click again
to finish a measurement.

<figure>
<img src="images/measurement_tool.png" alt="measurement tool" />
</figure>

The tool displays the total (radial) distance between the points, the
distance in X and Y directions, and the measured angle from horizontal.
In other words, both the Cartesian and radial (polar) distances are
displayed.

<div class="note">

The measurement tool is used for quick measurements that do not need to
be displayed permanently. Any measurement you make will only be shown
while the tool is active. To create permanent dimensions that will
appear in printouts and plots, use the Dimension tools.

</div>

## Find tool

The Find tool searches for text in the PCB, including reference
designators, footprint fields, and graphic text. When the tool finds a
match, the canvas is zoomed and centered on the match and the text is
highlighted. Launch the tool using the (![Find
icon](images/icons/find_24.png)) button in the top toolbar.

<figure>
<img src="images/find_dialog.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="Find dialog" />
</figure>

The Find tool has several options:

**Match case:** Selects whether the search is case-sensitive.

**Whole words only:** When selected, the search will only match the
search term with complete words in the PCB. When unselected, the search
will match if the search term is part of a larger word in the PCB.

**Wildcards:** When selected, wildcards can be used in the search terms.
`?` matches any single character, and `*` matches any number of
characters. Note that when this option is selected, partial matches are
not returned: searching for `abc*` will match the string `abcd`, but
searching for `abc` will not.

**Wrap:** When selected, search results will return to the first hit
after reaching the last hit.

**Search footprint reference designators:** Selects whether the search
should apply to footprint reference designators.

**Search footprint values:** Selects whether the search should apply to
footprint value fields.

**Search other text items:** Selects whether the search should apply to
other text items, including graphical text and footprint fields other
than value and reference.

**Search DRC markers:** Selects whether the search should apply to the
violation descriptions of DRC markers shown on the board.

**Search net names:** Selects whether the search should apply to the
names of nets in the board.

## Search panel

The search panel is a docked panel that lists information about
footprints, zones, nets, ratsnest lines (unrouted segments), and text
from the PCB. Show or hide the search panel with **View** → **Panels** →
**Search** or use the <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+G</span> shortcut.

<figure>
<img src="images/search_panel.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Search panel, with a footprint selected" />
</figure>

You can optionally filter the list based on a search string. When no
filter is used, all items in the design are listed in the corresponding
tab. Items are filtered based on their properties:

- Footprints are filtered by the contents of their fields. You can
  select whether to search hidden fields by enabling the **Search Hidden
  Fields** option in the ![config 16](images/icons/config_16.png) menu.
  Footprints are also filtered by their metadata (library link,
  description, and keywords) if **Search Metadata** is enabled in the
  ![config 16](images/icons/config_16.png) menu.

- Zones are filtered by the zone name.

- Net and ratsnest items are filtered by the net name.

- Text (text, textboxes, and dimensions) is filtered by the text
  content.

You can sort the filtered results in ascending or descending order of
the value in a particular column by clicking on that column header.

Filters support wildcards: `*` matches any characters, and `?` matches
any single character. You can also use [regular
expressions](http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_resyntax.html), such
as `/footprint value/`.

The displayed information depends on the item type:

- All items list their name and/or value.

- Physical items (footprints, zones, and text) additionally list their
  layer and X/Y location.

- Footprints additionally list their library link (library name and
  footprint name) and description.

- Text additionally lists the type of text object (text, textbox, or
  dimension).

- Net and ratsnest items additionally list their net name and net class.

When you click an item in the search panel, the item is selected in the
editing canvas. Depending on what is configured in the ![config
16](images/icons/config_16.png) menu, the board editor will also pan
and/or zoom to the selected item in the editing canvas. Double-clicking
an item in the search panel opens its properties dialog (for net and
ratsnest items, the [net classes dialog](#board-setup-net-classes) is
opened instead).

## 3D Viewer

The 3D Viewer shows a 3-dimensional view of the board and the components
on the board. You can view the board from different perspectives, show
or hide different types of components, cross-probe from the PCB Editor
to the 3D viewer, and generate raytraced renders of the board. Show the
3D Viewer with **View** → **3D Viewer** or use the
<span class="keycombo">Alt+3</span> shortcut.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/3d_viewer.png" alt="3D viewer" />
</figure>

<div class="note">

The 3D model for a component will only appear if the 3D model file
exists and has been [assigned to the
footprint](#working-with-footprints).

</div>

<div class="note">

Many footprints in KiCad’s standard library do not yet have model files
created for them. However, these footprints may contain a path to a 3D
model that does not yet exist, in anticipation of the 3D model being
created in the future.

</div>

### Navigating the 3D view

Dragging with the left mouse button will orbit the 3D view. By default
this is the centroid of the board, but the pivot point can be reset to a
new point on the board by moving the cursor over the desired point and
pressing Space. Scrolling the mouse wheel will zoom the view in or out.
Scrolling while holding Ctrl pans the view left and right, and scrolling
while holding Shift pans up and down. Dragging with the middle mouse
button also pans the view.

Different sized 3D grids can be set using the **View** → **3D Grid**
menu. Bounding boxes for each component can be enabled with
**Preferences** → **Show Model Bounding Boxes**.

When the PCB Editor and the 3D Viewer are both open, selecting a
footprint in the PCB Editor will also highlight the component in the 3D
Viewer. The highlight color is adjustable in **Preferences** →
**Preferences…​** → **3D Viewer** → **Realtime Renderer** → **Selection
Color**.

### Appearance Manager

The Appearance Manager is a panel at the right of the viewer which
provides controls to manage the visibility, color, and opacity of
different types of objects and board layers in the 3D view.

Each layer or type of object in the list can be individually shown or
hidden by clicking its corresponding visibility icon. PCB layers can
have their colors customized; double-click on the color swatch next to
the item type to edit the item’s color and opacity. To use the colors
selected in the Board Setup dialog’s Physical Stackup editor, enable the
**use board stackup colors** option. If you enable the **use PCB editor
copper colors** option, copper layers in the 3D viewer will use the
colors configured in the PCB editor canvas.

You can save an appearance configuration as a preset, or load a
configuration from a preset, using the **Preset** selector at the
bottom. The <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Tab</span> hotkey cycles through
presets; press Tab repeatedly while holding Ctrl to cycle through
multiple presets. Several built-in presets are available: "Follow PCB
Editor" matches the visibility settings in the PCB editor, "Follow PCB
Plot Settings" matches the visibility settings selected in the Plot
dialog, and "legacy colors" matches the default 3D Viewer color settings
from older versions of KiCad.

Finally, you can save a viewport for later retrieval using the
**Viewports** selector at the bottom. You can quickly cycle between
saved viewports using <span class="keycombo">Shift+Tab</span>; pressing
Tab repeatedly while holding Shift will cycle through multiple
viewports.

### Generating images with the 3D Viewer

The current 3D view can be saved to an image with **File** → **Export
Current View as PNG…​** or **Export Current View as JPG…​**, depending on
the desired image format. The current view can also be copied to the
clipboard using the ![copy icon](images/icons/copy_24.png) button, or
**Edit** → **Copy 3D Image**.

The 3D Viewer has a raytracing rendering mode which displays the board
using a more physically accurate rendering model than the default
rendering mode. Raytracing is slower than the default rendering mode,
but it can be used when the most visually attractive results are
desired. Raytracing mode is enabled with the ![raytracing
icon](images/icons/render_mode_24.png) button, or with **Preferences** →
**Raytracing**. The 3D grid and selection highlights are not shown in
raytracing mode.

Colors and other rendering options, for both raytraced and non-raytraced
modes, can be adjusted in **Preferences** → **Preferences…​** → **3D
Viewer**.

### 3D viewer controls

Many viewing options are controlled with the top toolbar.

## Net inspector

The Net Inspector is a docked panel that allows you to view statistics
about all the nets in a board. It also lets you add, remove, and rename
nets. To open the inspector, click the ![list nets
24](images/icons/list_nets_24.png) icon at the top of the Nets section
of the Appearance panel, or select **View** → **Panels** → **Net
Inspector**.

<figure>
<img src="images/net_inspector.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="net inspector" />
</figure>

Double-clicking a net in the list will [highlight](#net-highlighting)
that net on the board. You can also highlight a net by right clicking it
and selecting **Highlight Selected Net**. If multiple nets are selected,
this lets you highlight all of them at once. You can remove the net
highlighting by right clicking the net’s row in the Net Inspector and
selecting **Clear Net Highlighting**, in addition to the usual ways of
[removing net highlighting](#net-highlighting).

Clicking a column title allows you to sort the list of nets by that
column. The Filter box lets you limit the listed nets to those that
match the filter string. By default, the filter matches against both net
names and net class names, but you can filter by just one or the other
by selecting or deselecting **Filter by Net Name** or **Filter by
Netclass** under the ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) menu.

By default, nets with no connections and nets with no pads are not
shown. You can choose to show them by selecting **Show Unconnected
Nets** and **Show Zero Pad Nets** under the ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) menu.

The Net Inspector shows the following statistics for each net:

- **Pad Count** is the number of pads with that net, counting both
  surface mount and through hole pads.

- **Via Count** is the number of vias with that net.

- **Via Length** is the sum total length of all vias with that net. The
  full height of each via is always counted, even if the connections to
  the via are such that the full via height is not electrically used. In
  other words, Via Length is equal to Via Count multiplied by the
  stackup height of the board.

- **Track Length** is the total length of all track segments in a net,
  not accounting for topology. For example, in a branching net structure
  all branches are included in the total length. The track length is
  also reported per copper layer.

- **Die Length** is the total of all Pad to Die Length values set for
  pads on the net.

Each column can be shown or hidden in the ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Show / Hide Columns**
menu. You can save the Net Inspector statistics to a CSV file by
clicking ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Save Net Inspector
Report**. The generated report includes all nets and columns, even if
they are currently filtered or hidden in the Net Inspector.

### Grouping nets

You can group nets in the Net Inspector to organize them and view them
more easily. Each group displays the total statistics for all its
members, as if the group were a single net. For example, if you have a
signal with a series resistor breaking the signal into two nets, you
could create a group that contains both of these nets. This would allow
you to analyze the total length of both nets, rather than each
individually.

You can group nets by their net class by clicking ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Group by netclass**.
Alternatively, you can create custom groups based on net name patterns.
To create a new custom group, click ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Add Custom Group**. Any
nets that contain the specified pattern in their name will be shown as
part of the group and not shown outside of the group. For example, the
pattern `CAN` matches the nets `CAN_RX` and `CAN_TX`. Patterns are not
case sensitive.

The pattern can also use regular expressions to match nets if the
pattern is surrounded in slashes. For example, the pattern `/^AN/`
matches nets `AN0`, `AN1`, etc., but not `CAN`.

To remove a group and release its members back into the full list of
nets, click ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Remove Selected Custom
Group**. This action is also available in the right click menu. To
remove all groups at once, click ![options generic 16
16](images/icons/options_generic_16_16.png) → **Remove All Custom
Groups**.

### Editing nets

The Net Inspector allows you to create new nets in the board and remove
or rename existing nets. To create a new net, right click in the Net
Inspector and select **Add Net**, then provide a name for the new net.
To delete a net, right click it in the list of nets and choose **Delete
Selected Net**. If multiple nets are selected, they will all be deleted.
To rename a net, right click it and choose **Rename Selected Net**, then
provide a new name.

<div class="note">

Nets are usually not edited in the board. Instead, it is recommended to
define nets in the schematic. Nets are typically managed in the board by
creating or modifying a schematic and then using the [Update PCB From
Schematic](#forward-annotation) tool to update the nets in the board
based on the schematic design. The Net Inspector can be used to manage
nets in alternate workflows that do not use a schematic.

</div>

<div class="note">

Nets that are modified in the Board Editor will not effect the schematic
until the [schematic is updated from the PCB](#back-annotation) through
the back-annotation process.

</div>

### Differences between Net Inspector and Length Tuner

The Net Inspector may report different net lengths than the [length
tuner](#length-tuning), because the two tools have different purposes
and calculate track/net lengths differently. In short, the Net Inspector
sums up the total length of each track segment and via on a net, while
the length tuner calculates the effective electrical length of a path
between two points on a net. The specific differences are as follows:

- The Net Inspector reports track length as a simple sum of the length
  of each track segment on a net. The length tuner calculates an
  effective electrical length of a net, which includes optimizing paths
  through pads to calculate the shortest possible path.

- If a routed net has a branching topology, the Net Inspector total
  includes the length of each branch in the total. The length tuner
  calculates a point-to-point length; if there are any branches, the
  length tuner will stop at the closest branch and report the length up
  to the branch.

- The Net Inspector always includes the effective via height in its via
  length and total length calculations. If a via connects to tracks on
  both the top and bottom layers, the full via height is included in the
  length calculation. Otherwise, only the stackup height between the
  connected layers is included. The length tuner calculates effective
  via height in the same way as the Net Inspector, but via height is
  only included in the length calculation when the **use stackup
  height** setting is enabled [board constraint
  settings](#board-setup-constraints). If the setting is disabled, the
  length tuner will not include vias in its calculations at all.

# Generating outputs

KiCad can generate and export files in a number of different formats
useful for manufacturing PCBs and interfacing with external software.
This functionality is available in the File menu in a few different
sections.

- The **Fabrication Outputs** section contains the most common
  operations needed to prepare a PCB for fabrication.

- The **Export** section contains tools for generating files that can be
  read by external software.

- The **Plot** function allows you to export 2D line drawings of the PCB
  in various formats.

- The **Print** function allows you to send a view of the PCB to a 2D
  printer.

## Fabrication outputs and plotting

KiCad uses Gerber files as its primary plotting format for PCB
manufacturing. To create Gerber files, open the **Plot…​** dialog from
the **File** menu, or select **Gerbers (.gbr)…​** from the **Fabrication
Outputs** section of the **File** menu. The Plot dialog will open,
allowing you to configure and generate Gerber files.

<figure>
<img src="images/plot_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="plot dialog" />
</figure>

The **Plot** button generates output files according to the selected
options. Messages from the plotting process are shown in the Output
Messages panel, and can be filtered by the checkboxes.

The **Generate Drill Files…​** button opens the [Generate Drill Files
dialog](#drill-files). **Run DRC…​** opens the [Design Rules
Checker](#design-rule-checking).

### Plotting options

- **Include Layers:** Check that every layer used on your board is
  enabled in the list. Disabled layers will not be plotted.

- **Plot on All Layers:** Selected layers will be included in the plot
  for each layer selected in the **include layers** list. The additional
  layers are plotted on top of the base layer. You can reorder these
  layers using the arrow buttons at the bottom; items that are lower in
  the list are plotted after (on top of) items that are higher in the
  list.

- **Output directory:** Specify the location to save plotted files. If
  this is a relative path, it is created relative to the project
  directory. Use the ![small new window
  16](images/icons/small_new_window_16.png) button to open the output
  directory in a file browser.

- **Plot drawing sheet:** If enabled, the drawing sheet border and title
  block will be plotted on each layer. This should usually be disabled
  when plotting Gerber files.

- **Subtract soldermask from silkscreen:** When enabled, silkscreen will
  be automatically removed from board areas that aren’t covered by
  soldermask.

- **Indicate DNP on fabrication layers:** If enabled, fabrication layers
  (`F.Fab` and `B.Fab`) will indicate when a footprint has the DNP (Do
  Not Populate) attribute set. DNP footprints are either not plotted on
  the fabrication layers (**Hide**) or are plotted with an X drawn
  through them on the front and back fabrication layer (**Cross-out**).

- **Sketch pads on fabrication layers:** If enabled, the outlines of
  footprint pads will be drawn on fabrication layers (`F.Fab` or
  `B.Fab`). If **Include pad numbers** is enabled, pad numbers will be
  drawn as well.

- **Drill marks:** For plot formats other than Gerber, marks may be
  plotted at the location of all drilled holes. Drill marks may be
  created at the actual size (diameter) of the finished hole, or at a
  smaller size.

- **Scaling:** For plot formats that support scaling other than 1:1, the
  plot scale may be set. The Auto scaling setting will scale the plot to
  fit the specified page size.

- **Use drill/place file origin:** When enabled, the coordinate origin
  for plotted files will be the drill/place file origin set in the board
  editor. When disabled, the coordinate origin will be the absolute
  origin (top left corner of the worksheet).

- **Mirrored plot:** For some plot formats, the output may be mirrored
  horizontally when this option is set.

- **Negative plot:** For some plot formats, the output may be set to
  negative mode. In this mode, shapes will be drawn for the empty space
  inside the board outline, and empty space will be left where objects
  are present in the PCB.

- **Check zone fills before plotting:** When enabled, zone fills will be
  checked (and refilled if outdated) before generating outputs. Plot
  outputs may be incorrect if this option is disabled!

<div class="note">

Versions of KiCad before 9.0 had a global control for tenting vias while
plotting. In KiCad 9.0, via tenting is globally controlled in [Board
Setup](#board-setup), and can be overridden in the [properties
dialog](#track-and-via-properties) for each via.

</div>

### Gerber options

- **Use Protel filename extensions:** When enabled, the plotted Gerber
  files will be named with file extensions based on Protel (`.GBL`,
  `.GTL`, etc). When disabled, the files will have the `.gbr` extension.

- **Generate Gerber job file:** When enabled, a Gerber job file
  (`.gbrjob`) will be generated along with any Gerber files. The Gerber
  job file is an extension to the Gerber format that includes
  information about the PCB stackup, materials, and finish. More
  information about Gerber job files is available at [the Ucamco
  website](https://www.ucamco.com/en/gerber/gerber-job-file).

- **Coordinate format:** Configure how coordinates will be stored in the
  plotted Gerber files. Check with your manufacturer for their
  recommended setting for this option.

- **Use extended X2 format:** When enabled, the plotted Gerber files
  will use the X2 format, which includes information about the netlist
  and other extended attributes. This format may not be compatible with
  older CAM software used by some manufacturers.

- **Include netlist attributes:** When enabled, the plotted Gerber files
  will include netlist information that can be used for checking the
  design in CAM software. When X2 format mode is disabled, this
  information is included as comments in the Gerber files.

- **Disable aperture macros:** When enabled, all shapes will be plotted
  as primitives rather than by using aperture macros. This setting
  should only be used for compatibility with old or buggy CAM software
  when requested by your manufacturer.

### PostScript options

- **Scale factor:** Controls how coordinates in the board file will be
  scaled to coordinates in the PostScript file. Using a different value
  for X and Y scale factors will result in a stretched / distorted
  output. These factors may be used to correct for scaling in the
  PostScript output device to achieve an exact-scale output.

- **Track width correction:** A global factor that is added (or
  subtracted, if negative) from the size of tracks, vias, and pads when
  plotting a PostScript file. This factor may be used to correct for
  errors in the PostScript output device to achieve an exact-scale
  output.

- **Force A4 output:** When enabled, the generated PostScript file will
  be A4 size even if the KiCad board file is a different size.

### SVG options

- **Precision:** Controls how many significant digits will be used to
  store coordinates.

- **Output mode:** Controls whether the generated SVG file is in color
  or black and white.

- **Fit page to board:** When enabled, the generated SVG will have the
  same size as the board outline.

### DXF options

- **Plot graphic items using their contours:** Graphic shapes in DXF
  files have no width. This option controls how graphic shapes with a
  width (thickness) in a KiCad board are plotted to a DXF file. When
  this option is enabled, the outer contour of the shape will be
  plotted. When this option is disabled, the centerline of the shape
  will be plotted (and the shape’s thickness will not be visible in the
  resulting DXF file).

- **Use KiCad font to plot text:** When enabled, text in the KiCad
  design will be plotted as graphic shapes using the KiCad font. When
  disabled, text will be plotted as DXF text objects, which will use a
  different font and will not appear in exactly the same position and
  size as shown in the KiCad board editor.

- **Export units:** Controls the units that will be used in the DXF
  file. Since the DXF format has no specified units system, you must
  export using the same units setting that you want to use for importing
  into other software.

### PDF options

- **Output mode:** Controls whether the generated PDF file is in color
  or black and white.

- **Generate property popups for front footprints:** When enabled,
  interactive popups will be added to the generated PDF containing part
  information for each footprint on the front of the board.

- **Generate property popups for back footprints:** When enabled,
  interactive popups will be added to the generated PDF containing part
  information for each footprint on the back of the board. For details,
  see the [Schematic Editor
  documentation](../eeschema/eeschema_generating_outputs.xml#interactive-pdf-features).

- **Generate metadata from AUTHOR and SUBJECT variables:** Sets the
  Author and Subject PDF document properties for the generated PDF based
  on the `AUTHOR` and `SUBJECT` [project text
  variables](#board-setup-text-variables), if you have defined them.

- **Single document:** When enabled, each layers will be plotted as an
  individual sheet within a single PDF document. When disabled, each
  layer will be plotted as a separate PDF file.

- **Background color:** Sets the background color for the PDF plot.
  Background color is not available when the output mode is black and
  white.

## Drill files

KiCad can generate CNC drilling files required by most PCB manufacturing
processes in either Excellon or Gerber X2 format. KiCad can also
generate a drill map: a graphical plot of the board showing drill
locations. To open the dialog, select the **Drill Files (.drl)…​** option
from the **Fabrication Outputs** section of the **File** menu, or click
the **Generate Drill Files…​** button in the Plot dialog.

<figure>
<img src="images/generate_drill_files_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="generate drill files dialog" />
</figure>

- **Output folder:** Choose the folder to save generated drill and map
  files to. If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the
  project directory.

- **Drill file format:** Choose whether to generate Excellon drill files
  (required by most PCB manufacturers) or Gerber X2 files.

- **Mirror Y axis:** For Excellon files, choose whether or not to mirror
  the Y-axis coordinate. This option should in general not be used when
  having PCBs manufactured by a third party, and is provided for
  convenience for users who are making PCBs themselves.

- **Minimal header:** For Excellon files, choose whether to output a
  minimal header rather than a full file header. This option should not
  be enabled unless requested by your manufacturer.

- **PTH and NPTH in single file:** By default, plated holes and
  non-plated holes will be generated in two different Excellon files.
  With this option enabled, both will be merged into a single file. This
  option should not be enabled unless requested by your manufacturer.

- **Use alternate drill mode for oval holes:** Controls how oval holes
  are represented in an Excellon drill file. When not enabled, a route
  command is used to represent oval holes. This is correct for most
  manufacturers. Only choose the **Use alternate drill mode** setting if
  requested by your manufacturer.

- **Generate map:** Choose whether to generate a drill map and, if so,
  in which format. Supported formats are Postscript, Gerber X2, DXF,
  SVG, and PDF.

- **Origin:** Choose the coordinate origin for drill files. **Absolute**
  will use the page origin at the top left corner. **Drill/place file
  origin** will use the origin specified in the board design.

- **Drill units:** Choose the units for drill coordinates and sizes.

- **Zeros:** Controls how zeroes are formatted in an Excellon drill
  file. Select an option here based on your manufacturer’s
  recommendations.

## IPC-2581 files

IPC-2581 files are XML files that contain complete fabrication and
assembly data for a board design. If your manufacturer accepts IPC-2581
files, these can replace Gerber files, drill files, and component
placement files. To create an IPC-2581 file, select **IPC-2581 File
(.xml)…​** from the **Fabrication Outputs** section of the **File** menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/generate_ipc_2581_files_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="generate ipc 2581 files dialog" />
</figure>

IPC-2581 output has the following options:

- **File:** Choose the filename for the generated IPC-2581 file. If a
  relative path is entered, it will be relative to the project
  directory.

- **Units:** Choose the units for the generated file. Can be
  **millimeters** or **inches**.

- **Precision:** Choose the number of digits after the decimal point for
  numbers in the generated file.

- **Version:** Choose the IPC-2581 standard version (B or C).

- **Compress output:** If enabled, the generated file will be compressed
  as a ZIP file.

- **Internal ID:** Choose the footprint field to use for the BOM’s
  internal ID column. This can be a generated unique ID or set to any
  footprint field in the design.

- **Manufacturer P/N:** Choose the footprint field to use for the BOM’s
  manufacturer part number column. This can be omitted or set to any
  footprint field in the design.

- **Manufacturer:** Choose the footprint field to use for the BOM’s
  manufacturer column. This can be omitted or set to any footprint field
  in the design.

- **Distributor P/N:** Choose the footprint field to use for the BOM’s
  distributor part number column. This can be omitted or set to any
  footprint field in the design.

- **Distributor:** Choose the footprint field to use for the BOM’s
  distributor column. This can be omitted or set to any footprint field
  in the design.

## ODB++ files

ODB++ output is a database of files that contains complete fabrication
and assembly data for a board design. If your manufacturer accepts ODB++
files, these can replace Gerber files, drill files, and component
placement files. To create an ODB++ file, select **ODB++ Output File…​**
from the **Fabrication Outputs** section of the **File** menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/odb.png" alt="odb" />
</figure>

ODB++ output has the following options:

- **Output file:** Choose the filename for the generated ODB++ file. If
  a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the project
  directory.

- **Units:** Choose the units for the generated file. Can be
  **millimeters** or **inches**.

- **Precision:** Choose the number of digits after the decimal point for
  numbers in the generated file.

- **Compression format:** Choose the type of compression for the
  generated output. Can be **ZIP**, **TGZ**, or **none**. If none, the
  output will be a folder.

## Component placement files

Component placement files are text files that list each component
(footprint) on the board along with its center position and orientation.
These files are usually used for programming pick-and-place machines,
and may be required by your manufacturer if you are ordering
fully-assembled PCBs. To create placement files, select **Component
Placement (.pos, .gbr)…​** from the **Fabrication Outputs** section of
the **File** menu.

<div class="note">

A footprint will not appear in generated placement files if the "Exclude
from position files" option is enabled for that footprint. This may be
used for excluding certain footprints that do not represent physical
components to be assembled. You can also optionally exclude DNP
components, depending on your manufacturer’s requirements.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/generate_placement_files_dialog.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="generate placement files dialog" />
</figure>

- **Format:** Choose between generating a plain text (ASCII),
  comma-separated text (CSV), or Gerber X3 placement file format.

- **Units:** Choose the units for component locations in the placement
  file.

- **Include only SMD footprints:** When enabled, only footprints with
  the SMD fabrication attribute will be included. Check with your
  manufacturer to determine if non-SMD footprints should be included or
  excluded from the position file.

- **Exclude all footprints with through hole pads:** When enabled,
  footprints will be excluded from the placement file if they contain
  any through-hole pads, even if their fabrication type is set to SMD.

- **Exclude all footprints with the Do Not Populate flag set:** When
  enabled, footprints will be excluded from the placement file if they
  have the Do Not Populate attribute set. Check with your manufacturer
  to determine if DNP components should be included or excluded from the
  position file.

- **Include board edge layer:** For Gerber placement files, controls
  whether or not the board outline is included with the footprint
  placement data.

- **Use drill/place file origin:** When enabled, component positions
  will be relative to the drill/place file origin set in the board
  design. When disabled, the positions will be relative to the page
  origin (upper left corner).

- **Use negative X coordinates for footprints on bottom layer:** When
  enabled, the X coordinates will be flipped (negated) for footprints on
  the bottom layer.

- **Generate single file with both front and back positions:** When
  enabled, positions for front and back footprints will be saved in a
  single file. When disabled, separate files will be generated for front
  and back footprints.

## Additional fabrication outputs

KiCad can also generate footprint report files, IPC-D-356 netlist files,
and a bill of materials (BOM) from the board design. These output
formats have no configurable options.

## Printing

KiCad can print the board view to a standard printer using the Print
action in the File menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/print_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="print dialog" />
</figure>

- **Include layers:** Select the layers to include in the printout.
  Unselected layers will be invisible. Right-click the list for layer
  selection commands.

- **Output mode:** Choose whether to print in black and white or full
  color.

- **Print drawing sheet:** When enabled, the page border and title block
  will be printed.

- **Print according to objects tab of appearance manager:** When
  enabled, any objects that have been hidden in the Objects tab of the
  Appearance panel will be hidden in the printout. When disabled, these
  objects will be printed if the layer they appear on is selected in the
  Included Layers area.

- **Print background color:** When printing in full color, this option
  controls whether or not the view background color will be printed.

- **Use a different color theme for printing:** When printing in full
  color, this option allows a different color theme to be used for
  printing. When disabled, the color theme used by the board editor will
  be used for printing.

- **Drill marks:** Controls whether to show drilled holes at their
  actual size, at a small size, or hide them from the printout.

- **Print mirrored:** When enabled, the printout will be mirrored
  horizontally.

- **Print one page per layer:** When enabled, each layer selected in the
  Included Layers area will be printed to an individual page. If this
  option is enabled, the **Print board edges on all pages** option
  controls whether to add the Edge.Cuts layer to each printed page.

- **Scale:** controls the scale of the printout relative to the page
  size configured in Page Setup.

## Exporting files

KiCad can export a board design to various third-party formats for use
with external software. These functions are found in the **Export**
section of the **File** menu.

### Specctra DSN exporter

The Specctra DSN exporter creates a file suitable for importing into
certain third-party autorouter software. This exporter has no
configurable options.

### GenCAD exporter

The GenCAD exporter creates a GenCAD file for fabrication, testing, or
importing into other software.

<figure>
<img src="images/gencad_exporter.png" alt="gencad exporter" />
</figure>

The GenCAD exporter has several options.

- **Flip bottom footprint padstacks:** If enabled, separate flipped
  padstack definitions will be added for bottom-side footprints. This
  may be necessary for importing into some third-party software.

- **Generate unique pin names:** If enabled, a suffix will be added to
  each pin name so that no footprint in the generated file will have two
  pins with the same name.

- **Generate a new shape for each footprint instance:** If enabled, a
  unique footprint will be output for every footprint instance, even if
  two footprints are identical.

- **Use drill/place file origin as origin:** If enabled, coordinates in
  the generated file will be relative to the drill/place file origin.

- **Save the origin coordinates in the file:** If enabled, the selected
  origin coordinates will be included in the generated file. If not
  enabled, the origin in the generated file will be set to (0,0).

### VRML exporter

The VRML exporter creates a VRML (`.wrl`) 3D model file containing the
PCB and any VRML files specified in footprints. VRML models are suitable
for use in applications where visual appearance is important and
dimensional accuracy is not critical.

<figure>
<img src="images/vrml_exporter.png" alt="vrml exporter" />
</figure>

The VRML exporter has several options.

- **Coordinate origin options:** Selects the origin for the generated
  model. If **user defined origin** is selected, you can manually
  specify the origin point.

- **Units:** Selects the unit system for the generated model. Dimensions
  in the generated model will be scaled appropriately.

- **Ignore 'Do not populate' components:** If enabled, VRML files for
  footprints with the 'Do not populate' attribute set will not be
  included.

- **Ignore 'Unspecified' components:** If enabled, VRML files for
  footprints with the 'Unspecified' footprint type will not be included.

- **Copy 3D model files to 3D model path:** If enabled, VRML files
  referenced in footprints will be copied into a subdirectory of the
  directory containing the generated board VRML model, and the generated
  model will reference the copied files. The subdirectory name is set by
  the **footprint 3D model path** field. If disabled, VRML files
  referenced in footprints will be embedded in the generated VRML files.

- **Use relative paths to model files in board VRML file:** If enabled,
  references to external models will use paths relative to the generated
  board VRML file. If disabled, the references will use absolute paths.
  This option is only available when the **copy 3D model files to 3D
  model path** option is enabled.

### IDF exporter

The IDF exporter exports an
[IDFv3](http://www.simplifiedsolutionsinc.com/images/idf_v30_spec.pdf)
compliant board (`.emn`) and library (`.emp`) file for communicating
mechanical dimensions to a mechanical CAD package. The exporter exports
the board outline and cutouts, all pad and mounting through holes
including slotted holes, and component outlines; this is the most basic
set of mechanical data required for interaction with mechanical
designers. All other entities described in the IDFv3 specification are
currently not exported.

<div class="note">

You must attach IDF component models to your design’s footprints before
they will be included in the exported model. For more information on
attaching models to footprints, see the [footprint
documentation](#creating-and-editing-footprints). Some IDF-specific
guidance is included in the [Advanced Topics
documentation](#idf-component-outlines).

</div>

<div class="note">

For more information on creating IDF component models, including
descriptions of the IDF utility tools included with KiCad, see the
[Advanced Topics documentation](#idf-component-outlines).

</div>

Once models have been specified for all desired components, the model of
the board can be exported. In the PCB Editor, select **File** →
**Export** → **IDFv3…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/idf_export.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="IDF output settings" />
</figure>

- **Grid reference point:** Choose where the exported model’s reference
  point should be. If the **Adjust automatically** option is selected,
  KiCad will set the reference point to the centroid of the PCB.
  Otherwise, the reference point is set relative to the display origin.

- **Output units:** Choose whether the exported model’s units are
  millimeters or mils.

- **Ignore 'Do not populate' components:** If enabled, IDF files for
  footprints with the 'Do not populate' attribute set will not be
  included.

- **Ignore 'Unspecified' components:** If enabled, IDF files for
  footprints with the 'Unspecified' footprint type will not be included.

The outputs can be viewed directly in a mechanical CAD application or
converted to VRML using the [`idf2vrml` tool](#idf2vrml).

### 3D model exporter (STEP / GLB / BREP / XAO / PLY / STL / STPZ)

The 3D model exporter creates a 3D model file from the PCB and any STEP
files specified in footprints. A number of formats are supported:

- STEP

- GLB (binary glTF)

- BREP (OCCT-native boundary representation)

- XAO (SALOME/Gmsh)

- PLY

- STL

- STPZ (GZIP-compressed STEP)

Different formats may be appropriate for different usecases. For
example, STEP models are suitable for use in mechanical CAD
applications, while XAO models are useful for physical simulations.

<div class="note">

KiCad’s footprint library includes both STEP and VRML (`.wrl`) versions
of each model. However, footprints in KiCad’s library only reference the
VRML versions of the models. VRML models are not included in STEP
exports, but the STEP exporter will instead include the corresponding
STEP version of the model if the **subsitute similarly named models**
option is enabled.

</div>

<div class="note">

KiCad can also export 3D models in [VRML](#vrml-exporter) and
[IDF](#idf-exporter) formats, but these formats use separate exporters.

</div>

To use the 3D model exporter, click **File** → **Export** → **STEP / GLB
/ BREP / XAO / PLY / STL…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/step_exporter.png" alt="step exporter" />
</figure>

Choose a 3D model format from the **Format** dropdown menu and specify
an output filename in the **File** selector.

There are a number of options for configuring the output model.

#### Board options

- **Export board body:** If enabled, the board body (non-copper) will be
  modeled in the exported model.

- **Cut vias in board body:** If enabled, via holes will be cut in the
  board body even if conductor layers are not modeled.

- **Export silkscreen:** If enabled, silkscreen will be modeled in the
  exported model. Silkscreen is modeled as a set of flat faces; it is
  not three-dimensional.

- **Export solder mask:** If enabled, solder mask will be modeled in the
  exported model. Solder mask is modeled as a set of flat faces; it is
  not three-dimensional.

- **Export components:** If enabled, 3D models for components will be
  included in the exported model (but see **Substitute similarly named
  models**, below). If **All components** is selected, models for all
  components in the PCB will be included. If **Only selected** is
  chosen, only models for the footprints currently selected in the board
  will be included. If **Components matching filter** is selected, only
  models for footprints with references matching the filter will be
  included. The filter supports wildcards and commas, so `C1,R*` will
  include `C1` and all resistors.

#### Conductor options

- **Export tracks and vias:** If enabled, tracks and vias on outer
  layers will be modeled in the exported model.

- **Export pads:** If enabled, pads will be modeled in the exported
  model.

- **Export zones:** If enabled, zones on outer layers will be modeled in
  the exported model.

- **Export inner conductor layers:** If enabled, inner conductor layers
  will be modeled in the exported model.

- **Fuse shapes (time consuming):** If enabled, intersecting geometry
  will be fused into a single shape. This may make the exported file
  easier to work with in some tools, but it also significantly increases
  the export time.

- **Fill all vias:** If enabled, via holes will not be cut in conductor
  layers.

- **Net filter (supports wildcards):** If filled, only conductors
  corresponding to nets that match the filter will be modeled. The
  filter supports wildcards, so `/tx_*` will model `/tx_p` and `/tx_n`
  conductors.

#### Coordinates

- **Coordinates:** Selects the origin for the generated model. If **user
  defined origin** is selected, you can manually specify the origin
  point.

#### Other options

- **Ignore 'Do not populate' components:** If enabled, components with
  the DNP attribute set will not be included in the exported model.

- **Ignore 'Unspecified' components:** If enabled, components with the
  Unspecified footprint type will not be included in the exported model.

- **Substitute similarly named models:** VRML models cannot be used in
  STEP, BREP, or XAO exports, but if this option is enabled the exporter
  will look for an identically named STEP model to include in the export
  instead of a footprint’s specified VRML model. Note that footprints in
  KiCad’s footprint library specify VRML models, but suitably named STEP
  models are also included for each VRML model. Therefore this option
  must be enabled in order to export 3D models for footprints from
  KiCad’s library using this dialog.

- **Overwrite old file:** If enabled, the exported model will overwrite
  an existing file with the same name.

- **Don’t write P-curves to STEP file** If enabled, parametric curves
  will be disabled in the exported STEP/STPZ model. This reduces the
  file size, but may reduce compatibility with some software.

- **Board outline chaining tolerance:** Controls the minimum distance
  between two points for the points to be considered coincident. If the
  board outline in the exported model is not contiguous, try increasing
  this tolerance.

### Footprint association (CMP) exporter

CMP files are used to sync footprint assignments and some other
footprint fields between the PCB and the schematic. You can import CMP
files into the schematic using the schematic editor’s **File** →
**Import** → **Footprint Assignments** menu item. This provides a very
limited form of [back
annotation](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#backannotation). It is recommended
to use the Update Schematic from PCB tool instead.

This exporter has no configurable options.

### Hyperlynx exporter

The Hyperlynx exporter creates a file suitable for importing into Mentor
Graphics (Siemens) HyperLynx simulation and analysis software. This
exporter has no configurable options.

# Footprints and footprint libraries

KiCad organizes footprints into footprint libraries, which hold
collections of footprints. Each footprint in a board is uniquely
identified by a full name that is composed of a library nickname and a
footprint name. For example, the identifier
`Capacitor_SMD:C_0603_1608Metric` refers to the `C_0603_1608Metric`
footprint in the `Capacitor_SMD` library.

## Managing footprint libraries

KiCad uses a table of footprint libraries to map footprint libraries of
any supported library type to a library nickname. KiCad uses a global
footprint library table as well as a table specific to each project. To
edit either footprint library table, use **Preferences** → **Manage
Footprint Libraries…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/fp_lib_table.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="footprint library table dialog" />
</figure>

The global footprint library table contains the list of libraries that
are always available regardless of the currently loaded project. The
table is saved in the file `fp-lib-table` in the KiCad configuration
folder. [The location of this
folder](../kicad/kicad.xml#config-file-location) depends on the
operating system being used.

The project specific footprint library table contains the list of
libraries that are available specifically for the currently loaded
project. If there are any project-specific footprint libraries, the
table is saved in the file `fp-lib-table` in the project folder.

KiCad’s footprint library management system allows directly using many
types of footprint libraries, including formats that are native to other
non-KiCad EDA tools:

- KiCad `.pretty` footprint libraries (folders with `.pretty` extension,
  containing `.kicad_mod` files)

- KiCad Legacy footprint libraries (`.mod` files)

- Altium Designer (`.PcbLib` or `.IntLib` files)

- CADSTAR PCB Archive (`.cpa` files)

- Eagle footprint libraries (`.lbr` files)

- EasyEDA / JLCEDA Standard Edition (`.json` or `.zip` files)

- EasyEDA / JLCEDA Professional Edition (`.elibz`, `.epro`, or `.zip`
  files)

- GEDA libraries (folders containing `.fp` files)

Non-KiCad footprint libraries, including KiCad Legacy footprint
libraries, can be migrated to KiCad `.pretty` format using the **Migrate
Libraries** button (see the [migrating
libraries](#migrating-footprint-libraries) section).

<div class="note">

KiCad only supports writing to KiCad’s native `.pretty` format footprint
libraries (and the `.kicad_mod` footprint files within them). All other
footprint library formats are read-only. To modify a non-KiCad format
footprint library, you must first convert it to KiCad format.

</div>

### Initial Configuration

The first time the PCB Editor (or any other KiCad tool that uses
footprints) runs and the global footprint table file `fp-lib-table` is
not found, KiCad will guide the user through setting up a new footprint
library table. This process is described
[above](#initial-configuration). You can re-run this process at any time
by clicking the **Reset Libraries**.

<div class="warning">

Resetting your footprint library table will permanently change your
footprint library table on disk.

</div>

### Managing Table Entries

Footprint libraries can only be used if they have been added to either
the global or project-specific footprint library table.

Add a library either by clicking the ![Folder
icon](images/icons/small_folder_16.png) button and selecting a library
or clicking the ![Plus icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) button and
typing the path to a library file. The selected library will be added to
the currently opened library table (Global or Project Specific).
Libraries can be removed by selecting desired library entries and
clicking the ![Delete icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button.

The ![Up icon](images/icons/small_up_16.png) and ![Down
icon](images/icons/small_down_16.png) buttons move the selected library
up and down in the library table. This does not affect the display order
of libraries in the Footprint Library Browser, Footprint Editor, or Add
Footprint tool.

Libraries can be made inactive by unchecking the **Active** checkbox in
the first column. Inactive libraries are still in the library table but
do not appear in any library browsers and are not loaded from disk,
which can reduce loading times.

A range of libraries can be selected by clicking the first library in
the range and then Shift-clicking the last library in the range.

Each library must have a unique nickname: duplicate library nicknames
are not allowed in the same table. However, nicknames can be duplicated
between the global and project library tables. Libraries in the project
table take precedence over libraries with the same name in the global
table.

Library nicknames do not have to be related to the library filename or
path. The colon character (`:`) cannot be used in library nicknames or
footprint names because it is used as a separator between nicknames and
footprints.

Each library entry must have a valid path. Paths can be defined as
absolute, relative, or by [path variable
substitution](#fp-path-variable-substitution).

The appropriate library format must be selected in order for the library
to be properly read. The supported formats are listed above. Only KiCad
format libraries (`.pretty` folders containing `.kicad_mod` files) can
be saved. Other footprint library formats are read-only and must be
converted to KiCad format before you can modify them.

There is an optional description field to add a description of the
library entry. The option field is not used at this time so adding
options will have no effect when loading libraries.

### Path Variable Substitution

The footprint library tables support path variable substitution, which
allows you to define path variables containing custom paths to where
your libraries are stored. PATH variable substitution is supported by
using the syntax `${PATH_VAR_NAME}` in the footprint library path.

By default, KiCad defines several path variables which are described in
the [project manager
documentation](../kicad/kicad.xml#kicad-environment-variables). Path
variables can be configured in the **Preferences** → **Configure
Paths…​** dialog.

Using path variables in the footprint library tables allows libraries to
be relocated without breaking the footprint library tables, so long as
the path variables are updated when the library location changes.

<div class="note">

KiCad will automatically resolve versioned path variables from older
versions of KiCad to the value of the corresponding variable from the
current KiCad version, as long as the old variable is not explicitly
defined itself. For example, `${KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR}` will
automatically resolve to the value of `${KICAD9_FOOTPRINT_DIR}` if there
is no `KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR` variable defined.

</div>

`${KIPRJMOD}` is a special path variable that always expands to the
absolute path of the current project directory. `${KIPRJMOD}` allows
libraries to be stored in the project folder without having to use an
absolute path in the project library table. This makes it possible to
relocate projects without breaking their project library tables.

### Using the GitHub Plugin

<div class="note">

KiCad removed support for the GitHub library plugin in version 6.0.

</div>

### Migrating footprint libraries to KiCad format

Non-KiCad format libraries, including legacy libraries (`.mod` files),
are read-only. They need to be converted to KiCad format (`.kicad_mod`
files in a `.pretty` folder) before you can save changes to them.

<div class="note">

As with most KiCad files, newer versions of KiCad can open older-format
library files, but older versions of KiCad cannot read files once they
have been saved by a newer version of KiCad.

</div>

Libraries in other formats can be converted to KiCad libraries by
selecting them in the footprint library table and clicking the **Migrate
Libraries** button. Multiple libraries can be selected and migrated at
once by Ctrl-clicking or shift-clicking.

Libraries can also be converted one at a time by opening them in the
Footprint Editor and saving them as a new library.

## Creating and editing footprints

A footprint is the physical interface between a component package and a
circuit board. Footprints can contain:

- Pads, which define how the component will be physically assembled onto
  the footprint. When a footprint is added to a board, tracks are routed
  to pads, and pads provide a magnetic snapping point for the router to
  connect the pad to a track. Pad shapes and layers are fully
  customizable, and pads can have plated holes, unplated holes, or no
  hole.

- Graphic shapes and text for technical or aesthetic purposes. Graphics
  can be placed on physical layers (e.g. silkscreen or soldermask) or
  nonphysical layers. Graphic shapes can also be placed on copper
  layers, in which case they can make electrical connections.

- 3D models for mechanical CAD and visualization. 3D models are normally
  external files that footprints can link to, but they can optionally be
  embedded in footprints.

- Metadata associated with the footprint.

Footprints in KiCad are organized into footprint libraries, which
contain zero or more footprints. Generally footprints are logically
grouped by footprint category, function, and/or manufacturer. Each
library is a folder (usually ending in `.pretty`) containing a
`.kicad_mod` file for each footprint in the library.

### Footprint editor overview

KiCad provides a footprint editing tool that allows you to create
footprint libraries; add, edit, delete, or transfer footprints between
libraries; export footprints to files; and import footprints from files.
The Footprint Editor can be launched from the KiCad Project Manager or
from the Board Editor (**Tools** → **Footprint Editor**). You can also
open the Footprint Editor from the [a footprint in the
board](#board-editing-footprints); in this way you can edit either the
library copy or the board copy of that footprint in the editor.

<div class="note">

Editing the library version of a footprint will not affect any copies of
that footprint that have been added to a board until the board copy is
updated from the library. Conversely, editing the board version of a
footprint will not affect the library version of a footprint or any
other copies of that footprint in a board.

</div>

The Footprint Editor main window is shown below. It has three toolbars
for quick access to common features and a footprint viewing/editing
canvas. Not all commands are available on the toolbars, but all commands
are available in the menus.

In addition to the toolbars, there are collapsible panels for the
footprint tree and Properties Manager (not shown) on the left, and the
appearance panel and selection filter on the right. The bottom of the
window contains a message panel that shows details about the selected
object.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_overview.png"
alt="footprint editor overview" />
</figure>

#### Top toolbar

The main toolbar is at the top of the main window. It has buttons for
the undo/redo commands, zoom commands, footprint/pad properties dialogs,
and layer/grid management controls.

### Browsing, modifying, and saving footprints

The ![Footprint tree icon](images/icons/search_tree_24.png) button
displays or hides the list of available libraries, which allows you to
select an active library. When a new footprint is created, it will be
placed in the active library.

Clicking on a footprint name opens that footprint in the editor, and
hovering the cursor over the name of a footprint displays a preview of
the footprint.

After modification, a footprint can be saved in the current library or a
different library. To save the modified footprint in the current
library, click the ![Save icon](images/icons/save_24.png) button.

To save the footprint changes to a new footprint, click **File** →
**Save As…​**. The footprint can be saved in the current library or a
different library, and a new name can be set for the footprint.

To create a new file containing only the current footprint, click
**File** → **Export** → **Footprint…​**. This file will be a standard
footprint library which will contain only one footprint.

The editor can also open footprints from the board. To edit a footprint
from the board, right click a footprint in the Board Editor and select
**Open in Footprint Editor** (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+E</span>).
Alternatively, you can open a board footprint by pressing the ![load
module board 24](images/icons/load_module_board_24.png) button in the
Footprint Editor top toolbar and selecting the desired footprint.

Editing and saving the board copy of a footprint will only update that
footprint in the board; it will not update other copies of that
footprint in the board, and it will not change the original library copy
of the footprint. When you open the board copy of a footprint, the
Footprint Editor displays an info bar that warns you the library copy
will not be modified. You can click the link in this info bar to open
the library version of the footprint instead, or press
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+E</span>.

### Creating a new footprint library

You can create a new footprint library by clicking **File** → **New
Library…​**. At this point you must choose whether the new library should
be added to the global footprint library table or the project footprint
library table. Libraries in the global library table will be available
to all projects, while libraries in the project library table will only
be available in the current project.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_new_library.png"
alt="footprint editor new library" />
</figure>

Following selection of the library table, you must choose a name and
location for the new library. A new, empty library will be created at
the specified location.

### Creating a new footprint

To create a new footprint in the current footprint library, click the
![New Footprint icon](images/icons/new_footprint_24.png) button or click
**File** → **New Footprint…​**. A new, untitled footprint will be created
in the selected library.

To set the name of the footprint, open its [properties
dialog](#footprint-editor-properties) (![module options
24](images/icons/module_options_24.png) button or E). The name will set
the name of the footprint, which is used when assigning a footprint to a
symbol, and is also used as the filename of the footprint file on disk.

The new footprint will be empty except for several default text items.
The footprint contains two default (mandatory) footprint fields,
`Reference` and `Value`. `Reference` contains the text `REF**`, which
will be replaced with the reference designator of the footprint’s
corresponding symbol when the [footprint is added to the
board](#starting-from-a-schematic). `Value` is initially set to
`Untitled`, which can be changed, but this will also be updated with the
contents of the corresponding symbol’s `Value` field when the footprint
is added to the board. Finally, there is a footprint text item
containing the string `${REFERENCE}`, which is a [text
variable](#text-variable) that will resolve to the value of the
footprint’s `Reference` field once the footprint is on a board.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_empty_footprint.png"
alt="footprint editor empty footprint" />
</figure>

These items are centered on the footprint’s anchor (origin point), which
is indicated with a magenta cross symbol. The anchor can be repositioned
(changing the `(0, 0)` point for the footprint) by selecting the
![Anchor icon](images/icons/anchor_24.png) button and clicking on the
new desired anchor position.

<div class="note">

Rather than manually creating a footprint, for some common footprints
you can use a [footprint wizard](#footprint-wizards) to create a
footprint based on a set of parameters.

</div>

### Editing footprint properties

Footprints have a number of properties and metadata items that can be
defined. These include text fields, attributes that can be set or not
(such as Do Not Populate), clearance and zone connection settings, and
3D model paths. These are initially defined in the library copy of the
footprint, but they can be modified on a per-instance basis once a
footprint is added to a board. In other words, two copies of the same
footprint on a single board can their properties edited separately.

Some properties, namely text fields and attributes, will be
automatically set for each footprint in a board based on the fields and
attributes in the footprint’s corresponding schematic symbol. Fields and
attributes are synced from symbols to footprints when you perform the
[Update PCB From Schematic](#forward-and-back-annotation) action. They
are also synced from footprints back to symbols when you perform the
Update Schematic From PCB action.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_properties.png"
alt="footprint editor properties" />
</figure>

To edit footprint properties, click the ![module options
24](images/icons/module_options_24.png) button to show the Footprint
Properties dialog. You can also double click an empty spot in the
editing canvas.

#### Footprint name, description, and keywords

The footprint name, description, and keywords describe the footprint
itself. Together they are intended to describe the footprint and help
you select an appropriate footprint for each component. They are also
used when searching for footprints in the Footprint Editor and the Add
Footprint dialog.

The **footprint name** contains the name of the footprint. This is the
same as the footprint’s filename on disk, and is also initially the same
as the footprint’s `Value` field. However, the `Value` field can be
edited in the footprint editor, and when a footprint is added to a
board, its `Value` field will be updated with the value of the
footprint’s corresponding symbol.

The **description** is a description of the footprint. It should be
human readable, but it is also used when searching for a footprint.

<div class="note">

This description property is specifically a description of the
**footprint**. This is not to be confused with the `Description` field,
which will be set to the description of the footprint’s corresponding
**symbol** when the footprint is added to a board.

</div>

The **keywords** are space-separated words related to the footprint.
They are used when searching for a footprint.

#### Footprint fields

Footprints contain multiple fields, which are named values containing
information related to the footprint. Fields can be visible and shown on
any board layer, or they can be hidden and only shown in the footprint’s
properties. Some fields have special meaning to KiCad: `Reference` and
`Footprint` are both both used by KiCad to identify schematic symbols
and PCB footprints, for example. Other fields may contain information
that is important for a design but is not interpreted by KiCad, like
pricing or stock information for a part.

Any fields defined in a library footprint will be included in the
footprint when it is added to a board. You can also add new fields to
footprints in the board. Whether they are in the library footprint or
not, these fields can then be edited on a per-footprint basis in the
board. Symbol fields are also transferred to the board and added as
fields in the corresponding footprint.

<div class="note">

Footprint fields are different than graphic text. Fields are named, i.e.
they have both a name (`Reference`) and a value (`R101`), whereas
footprint text only has a value. Fields can be added to and deleted from
footprints in a board in the Footprint Properties dialog, while text
items can only be added to a footprint in the footprint editor. Fields
are also synced between footprints and their corresponding symbols in
the schematic. Before KiCad version 8.0, footprints did not have named
fields, only graphic text.

</div>

All library footprints are defined with four default fields which
correspond to the [default fields in library
symbols](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#symbol-properties): `Reference`,
`Value`, `Datasheet`, and `Description`. These default fields cannot be
deleted. The `Reference` field initially has the value `REF**`, while
the `Value` field is initially set to the name of the footprint. In the
board, the values of the four default fields will be set to the values
of the matching fields in the footprint’s corresponding symbol.

<div class="note">

The `Description` footprint field is the description of the symbol, not
the footprint, and will be overwritten by the value of the corresponding
symbol’s description. Footprints have a separate footprint description
property (not a field), which is specifically intended for a description
of the footprint.

</div>

Fields each have an associated layer, which determines which board layer
the field will be placed on. Fields can also be visible or hidden.

To edit an existing footprint field, double-click the field, select it
or hover and press E, or right-click on the field text and select
**Properties…​**.

To add new fields, delete optional fields, or edit existing fields, use
the ![module options 24](images/icons/module_options_24.png) icon on the
main tool bar to open the Footprint Properties dialog. Fields can be
arbitrarily named, but names starting with `ki_`, e.g. `ki_description`,
are reserved by KiCad and should not be used for user fields.

Fields have a number of properties, each of which is shown as a column
in the properties grid. Not all columns are shown by default; columns
can be shown or hidden by right clicking on the grid header and
selecting or deselecting columns from the menu.

#### Footprint attributes

Footprints have several attributes, which are properties of the
footprint that affect how it is handled by other parts of KiCad.

Every footprint has a **component type**: **SMD**, **Through hole**, or
**Unspecified**. A footprint’s type affects KiCad’s behavior in a few
ways:

- Footprint type controls the default type of new pads added to the
  footprint. For **through hole** and **Unspecified** footprints, new
  pads will be through hole by default, although they can be changed
  after creation. For **SMD** footprints, new pads will be SMD by
  default.

- Footprint type can be used to filter footprints from component
  placement files as well as other exports, such as STEP files.
  Additionally, the footprint type is included as metadata in IPC-2581
  exports.

- Footprint 3D models can be shown and hidden in the 3D viewer based on
  their type. For example, SMD models can be hidden while through hole
  models are still displayed.

- Footprints of different types are reported separately in the [Board
  Statistics dialog](#board-statistics).

- DRC will report footprints containing pads that do not match the
  parent footprint’s type, for example through hole pads in an SMD
  footprint.

If **not in schematic** is checked, KiCad will not expect the footprint
to correspond to a symbol in the schematic. When updating a PCB from the
schematic, KiCad will ordinarily remove footprints that don’t have
corresponding symbols according to the **delete footprints with no
symbols** setting. However, such footprints will not be deleted when
they have **not in schematic** set.

If **exclude from POS files** is checked, KiCad will not include the
footprint in component placement file exports.

If **exclude from bill of materials** is checked, the component will not
be included in bill of materials exports in either the schematic or PCB
editors. This attribute is synced to and from the footprint’s
corresponding schematic symbol.

If **exempt from courtyard requirement** is checked, the footprint will
not trigger a DRC violation if it does not contain a courtyard. Without
this attribute set, a footprint without graphics on the `F.Courtyard` or
`B.Courtyard` layer will cause a "Footprint has no courtyard defined"
DRC violation.

The **do not populate** attribute is primarily a schematic symbol
attribute, and is synced to and from the footprint’s corresponding
schematic symbol. Footprints with this attribute set can optionally be
excluded from component placement file exports and some other types of
outputs. These footprints can also be hidden in the 3D viewer.

#### Private footprint layers

Footprints can have private footprint layers, which are layers that can
be viewed and edited in the Footprint Editor but are not shown in the
footprint when it is added to a board. Therefore any objects that are on
private layers will not be visible in the PCB Editor or included in PCB
fabrication outputs. This may be useful, for example, for notes or
graphics that are of interest when drawing or editing a footprint but
not needed at the board level.

Any of the existing `User.*` layers (`User.Drawings`, `User.Comments`,
`User.Eco1`, `User.1`, etc.) can optionally be a private layer. To make
a layer private, add a private layer in the **General** tab of the
footprint properties dialog, then select the desired layer. Any objects
on that layer will not be shown on the board.

#### Clearance overrides and settings

The **Clearance Overrides and Settings** tab holds settings for
footprint-specific overrides to board clearance and mask/paste
expansion, pad-to-zone connections, and net tie settings for allowing
pads within the footprint to short different nets.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_properties_clearance.png"
alt="footprint editor properties clearance" />
</figure>

**Pad clearance** controls the minimum clearance between the footprint’s
pads and any copper shape (tracks, vias, pads, zones) on a different
net. This value is normally empty, which will cause the pad clearance to
be inherited from the board’s design rules and netclass rules. This
value can be overridden for individual pads by setting the pad’s
clearance to a nonblank value.

<div class="note">

Prior to KiCad version 9, a pad clearance of `0` caused the pad
clearance value to be inherited. In KiCad 9 and later, a pad clearance
of `0` sets the clearance to `0`, while a blank pad clearance causes the
clearance to be inherited.

</div>

The aperture appearing on any technical layer will have the same shape
and size as the pad shape on the copper layer(s). In the PCB
manufacturing process, the manufacturer will often change the relative
size of mask and paste apertures relative to the copper pad size, but
since this size change is specific to a manufacturing process, most
manufacturers expect the design data to be provided with the apertures
set to the same size as the copper pads. For specific situations where
you need to oversize or undersize a technical layer aperture in the
design data, you can use the settings here. These values can be
overridden for individual pads by setting the pad’s expansion or
clearance to a nonzero value.

**Solder mask expansion** controls the size difference between the pad
shape and the aperture shape on the F.Mask and B.Mask layers. A positive
number means the solder mask aperture will be larger than the copper
shape. This number is an inflation applied to all directions. For
example, a value of `0.1mm` here will cause the solder mask aperture to
be inflated by `0.1mm`, meaning that there will be an `0.1mm` border on
all sides of the pad and the solder mask opening will be `0.2mm` wider
than the pad when measured along a given axis.

**Solder paste absolute clearance** controls the size difference between
the pad shape and the aperture shape on the F.Paste and B.Paste layers.
Its behavior is otherwise identical to the behavior of the **solder mask
expansion** setting.

**Solder paste relative clearance** allows setting a solder paste
clearance value as a percentage of the pad size rather than an absolute
distance value. If both relative and absolute clearances are specified,
they are added together to determine the solder paste aperture size.

**Pad connection to zones** controls whether the footprint’s pads will
have solid, thermal relief, or no connection to zones. Like the other
overrides, this one may be set for an individual pad or for an entire
footprint. The default setting for this control is **From zone
setting**, which uses the connection mode specified in the connection
zones' properties. This setting can be overridden for individual pads by
setting the pad’s connection mode to a value other than **From parent
footprint**.

##### Creating net ties

Footprints can act as net ties, where two separate nets are electrically
connected by copper. Connecting nets together would normally causes a
DRC error due to violating the clearance between two nets, but a
footprint can be configured to short nets without causing a DRC
violation. This can be used to connect multiple grounds at a specific
location, to make kelvin sense connections to a component, or for other
applications.

<figure>
<img src="images/net_tie_group.png" alt="net tie group" />
</figure>

Net ties connect two or more nets in one contiguous region of copper.
Each net in a net tie must have its own pad. Pads are not ordinarily
allowed to short to other pads; to allow pads to be shorted in net ties,
the shorting pads must be added to a **net tie group**. To create a net
tie group, add the pad numbers of the shorting pads to the **Net Ties**
table in the **Clearance Overrides and Settings** tab of the Footprint
Properties dialog. For example, to allow pads `1` and `2` to short in a
footprint, add a line to the table with the contents `1,2`.

After creating a net tie group, the specified pads are allowed to be
electrically shorted. Pads in net tie groups can be connected either by
directly overlapping the pads or by adding a copper shape that overlaps
both pads.

Footprints can contain multiple net tie groups. Each group can short two
or more nets, but every group must remain electrically separate from
other groups.

#### 3D models

The **3D Models** tab allows you to attach external 3D model files to a
footprint and view the footprint in three dimensions along with any
attached models.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_properties_3dmodels.png"
alt="footprint editor properties 3dmodels" />
</figure>

The main part of the window is a 3D preview of the footprint and any
attached models. The buttons to the right of the preview let you enable
or disable an orthographic projection (![ortho
16](images/icons/ortho_16.png)), show or hide the PCB model (![axis3d
16](images/icons/axis3d_16.png)), align the view to one of the six
face-aligned perspectives (![axis3d left
16](images/icons/axis3d_left_16.png)), and refresh the view (![refresh
16](images/icons/refresh_16.png)). The bottom button (![options 3drender
16](images/icons/options_3drender_16.png)) lets you set the thickness of
the PCB in the preview.

The top of the dialog lets you attach external models. Each added model
will be shown in the footprint preview as well as in the full PCB 3D
view when the footprint is added to a board. Footprint models can be in
STEP, VRML, or [IDF](#idf-component-outlines) format. The models are
specified as paths to the model files, which can contain [path
variables](../kicad/kicad.xml#path-variables) such as `${KIPRJMOD}` or
`${KICAD9_3DMODEL_DIR}`. Click the **Configure Paths** button to
configure path variables. If there is a problem loading a model file
from the specified path, an icon in the leftmost column will indicate an
error.

<div class="note">

KiCad will automatically resolve versioned path variables from older
versions of KiCad to the value of the corresponding variable from the
current KiCad version, as long as the old variable is not explicitly
defined itself. For example, `${KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR}` will
automatically resolve to the value of `${KICAD9_FOOTPRINT_DIR}` if there
is no `KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR` variable defined.

</div>

<div class="note">

Many footprints in KiCad’s standard library do not yet have model files
created for them. However, these footprints may contain a path to a 3D
model that does not yet exist, in anticipation of the 3D model being
created in the future.

</div>

By default, models are added with their origin placed at the footprint’s
origin, with no offset, scaling, or rotation. Offset, scaling, and
rotation can be applied to a model using the controls to the left of the
preview canvas. The model’s opacity can be adjusted using the
**opacity** slider, and the model can be completely hidden by
deselecting the **show** checkbox in the rightmost column of the model
table.

### Embedding files in footprints

External files can be embedded within a footprint. Embedding a file
stores a copy of the file inside the footprint. The footprint can then
refer to the embedded copy of the file instead of the external file,
which makes the footprint more portable as it doesn’t rely on an
external file, although the footprint’s filesize is increased as a
result. In footprints this is especially useful for embedding 3D models.
Files embedded in a footprint are deduplicated when the footprint is
added to a board: if a file is embedded in a footprint, and multiple
instances of that footprint are added to the board, only one copy of the
file will be embedded, and all of the footprint instances will refer to
the same embedded file. Files embedded in a footprint cannot be referred
to in the parent board. File embedding is explained in more detail in
the [Board Setup documentation](#pcb-embedding-files).

<figure>
<img src="images/fp_embedded_files.png" alt="fp embedded files" />
</figure>

<div class="note">

You can add a 3D model to a footprint and embed it in one step. To do
so, add a 3D model in the **3D Models**, and enable the **Embed File**
checkbox in the file browser while choosing a model. This embeds the
file and automatically uses the embedded reference as the file path
instead of the path to the external file.

</div>

### Footprint pads

Pads are added to a footprint by clicking the ![pad
24](images/icons/pad_24.png) button in the right toolbar, then clicking
again in the desired location in the canvas. The tool continues adding
new pads each time you click on the canvas until you cancel the tool
(Esc).

New pads have their pad type set by the [footprint’s
type](#footprint-attributes), though you can change the pad type later.
New pads in SMD footprints are SMD by default, while pads in Through
Hole and Unspecified footprints are through hole. Each new pad has its
pad number incremented by 1 relative to the previous pad number.

#### Pad properties

You can edit a pad after adding it by opening the pad’s properties
dialog (E). These properties are also editable using the [Properties
Manager](#editing-object-properties).

##### General tab

The **General** tab of the pad properties dialog shows the physical
properties of the pad, including its geometry, shape, and layer
settings.

<figure>
<img src="images/pad_properties_general.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="pad properties general" />
</figure>

**Pad type:** this setting controls which features are enabled for the
pad:

- **SMD** pads are electrically-connected and have no hole. In other
  words, they exist on a single copper layer.

- **Through-hole** pads are electrically-connected and have a plated
  hole. The hole exists on every layer, and the copper pad exists on
  multiple layers (see **Copper layers** setting below).

- **Edge Connector** pads are SMD pads that are allowed to overlap the
  board outline on the `Edge.Cuts` layer.

- **NPTH, Mechanical** pads are non-plated through holes that do not
  have an electrical connection.

- **SMD Aperture** pads are pads that have no hole and no electrical
  connection. These can be used to add specific designs to a technical
  layer, for example a paste or solder mask aperture.

The **Copper layers** setting controls which copper layers will have a
shape associated with the pad.

For SMD pads, the options are `F.Cu` or `B.Cu`, controlling whether the
pad sits on the front or the back of the board *relative to the
footprint’s location*. In other words, if a pad is set to exist on
`B.Cu` in its properties, and the footprint is flipped to the back of
the board, *that pad will now exist on `F.Cu`, because it also has been
flipped*.

For through-hole pads, it is possible to remove the pad shape from
copper layers where the pad is not electrically connected to other
copper (tracks or filled zones). Setting the copper layers to
**connected layers only** will remove the pad shape from any unconnected
layers, and setting to **`F.Cu`, `B.Cu`, and connected layers** will
remove the pad shape from any internal unconnected layers. This can be
useful in dense board designs to increase the routable area on internal
layers.

The **Technical layers** checkboxes control which technical layers will
have an aperture added with the pad’s shape. By default, pads have
apertures on the paste and mask layers matching their copper layer.

<div class="note">

It is not possible to define a different pad shape or size on different
copper layers in the current version of KiCad.

</div>

The **Pad number** controls what the pad will be electrically connected
to in the board. A pad has the same net connection as the pin with the
same number in the corresponding schematic symbol.

Pad **Position X** and **Y** are the location of the center of the pad,
relative to the footprint’s origin.

**Pad shape** controls the basic shape of the pad. This can be
**circular**, **oval**, **rectangular**, **trapezoidal**, **rounded
rectangle**, **chamfered rectangle**, **chamfered with other corners
rounded**, **custom (circular base)**, or **custom (rectangular base)**.
Each pad shape has its own set of options; for example, rounded
rectangles have settings for **pad size X** and **Y**, **angle**,
**corner size**, and **corner radius**.

<div class="note">

The size of a pad can also be adjusted interactively in the canvas by
dragging the editing handles at the pad corners.

</div>

Through-hole and NPTH pads have a hole in addition to the pad itself.
The **hole shape** can be **circular** or **oval**, with corresponding
size controls. By default the pad is centered on the hole, but the pad
can be offset relative to the hole if the **offset shape from hole**
option is enabled (circular pads cannot be offset from the hole).

**Fabrication properties** are primarily used as metadata in Gerber X2
fabrication output, where the fabrication property is included as an
aperture attribute for each pad. Some properties also affect DRC. The
following fabrication properties are available:

- **BGA pad** can only be applied to SMD pads, and only affects Gerber
  X2 output.

- **Fiducial, local to footprint** and **fiducial, global to board**
  only affect Gerber X2 output.

- **Test point** can only be applied to SMD or through hole pads, can
  only be applied to pads on outer layers, and only affects Gerber X2
  output.

- Through hole pads with the **heatsink pad** property are allowed in
  SMD footprints (PTH pads without this property cause a DRC violation
  when they are used in SMD footprints). It also affects Gerber X2
  output.

- The **castellated pad** property is for pads that intentionally
  intersect the board edge such that they will be bisected when the
  board is manufactured. Pads with this property are allowed to
  intersect the board edge and still be routed (it is otherwise a DRC
  error for a pad to intersect the board edge, which makes routing
  impossible). In STEP exports, pads with this property are clipped to
  the board edge. This property also affects Gerber X2 output.

- Through hole pads with the **mechanical** property can be used in SMD
  footprints without causing a DRC violation. This can be used for
  mounting pads or other mechanical through hole pads in surface mount
  footprints. This is similar to the **heatsink pad** property, but does
  not affect Gerber X2 output.

- **None** is for pads for which none of the other fabrication
  properties apply. It has no effect.

**Specify pad to die length:** This setting allows a length to be
associated with this pad that will be added to the routed track length
by the track length tuning tools and the Net Inspector. This can be used
to specify internal bondwire lengths for more accurate length matching,
or in other situations where the electrical length of a net is longer
than the length of the routed tracks on the board.

##### Connections tab

The **Connections** tab contains settings for how pads connect to other
objects, including settings for teardrops, zone connections, and thermal
reliefs.

<figure>
<img src="images/pad_properties_connections.png"
alt="pad properties connections" />
</figure>

The Teardrops section contains settings controlling teardrop connections
between tracks and the pad, if teardrops are used. Teardrop settings are
explained in the [teardrop documentation](#editing-teardrops).

**Pad connection** controls whether the pad will have a solid, thermal
relief, or no connection to the zone. Like the other overrides, this one
may be set for an individual pad or for an entire footprint. The default
setting for this control is **From parent footprint**, and the default
footprint setting is to use the connection mode specified in the zone
properties.

**Zone knockout** controls the behavior of the zone filler when the pad
uses a custom shape rather than one of the default shapes. This can be
used to achieve different results when using thermal reliefs and custom
pad shapes.

**Relief gap** controls the length of the thermal spokes, or the gap
between the pad’s shape and the filled copper area of the zone. This
value is normally empty which will cause the relief gap to be inherited
from the connecting zone’s settings.

**Spoke width** controls the width of the spokes generated when the zone
connection mode is **Thermal Relief**. This value is normally empty
which will cause the spoke width to be inherited from the connecting
zone’s settings.

<div class="note">

Prior to KiCad version 9, a relief gap or spoke width of `0` caused that
value to be inherited. In KiCad 9 and later, a relief gap or spoke width
of `0` sets that value to `0`, while a blank value causes the value to
be inherited.

</div>

##### Clearance Overrides tab

The **Clearance Overrides** tab holds settings for pad-specific
overrides to board clearance and mask/paste expansion.

<figure>
<img src="images/pad_properties_overrides.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="pad properties overrides" />
</figure>

**Pad clearance** controls the minimum clearance between the pad and any
copper shape (tracks, vias, pads, zones) on a different net. This value
is normally empty which will cause the pad clearance to be inherited
from any clearance override set on the footprint, or the board’s design
rules and netclass rules if the footprint clearance is also empty.

<div class="note">

Prior to KiCad version 9, a pad clearance of `0` caused the pad
clearance value to be inherited. In KiCad 9 and later, a pad clearance
of `0` sets the clearance to `0`, while a blank pad clearance causes the
clearance to be inherited.

</div>

The aperture appearing on any technical layer will have the same shape
and size as the pad shape on the copper layer(s). In the PCB
manufacturing process, the manufacturer will often change the relative
size of mask and paste apertures relative to the copper pad size, but
since this size change is specific to a manufacturing process, most
manufacturers expect the design data to be provided with the apertures
set to the same size as the copper pads. For specific situations where
you need to oversize or undersize a technical layer aperture in the
design data, you can use the settings here.

**Solder mask expansion** controls the size difference between the pad
shape and the aperture shape on the F.Mask and B.Mask layers. A positive
number means the solder mask aperture will be larger than the copper
shape. This number is an inflation applied to all directions. For
example, a value of `0.1mm` here will cause the solder mask aperture to
be inflated by `0.1mm`, meaning that there will be an `0.1mm` border on
all sides of the pad and the solder mask opening will be `0.2mm` wider
than the pad when measured along a given axis.

**Solder paste absolute clearance** controls the size difference between
the pad shape and the aperture shape on the F.Paste and B.Paste layers.
Its behavior is otherwise identical to the behavior of the **solder mask
expansion** setting.

**Solder paste relative clearance** allows setting a solder paste
clearance value as a percentage of the pad size rather than an absolute
distance value. If both relative and absolute clearances are specified,
they are added together to determine the solder paste aperture size.

#### Working with multiple pads

When you place a new pad, the new pad’s properties are copied from the
**default pad properties**. Each time any pad is edited, the pad’s
updated properties are stored as the default pad properties, so that new
pads will match the properties of the most recently edited pad.

You can directly edit the default pad properties by selecting **Edit** →
**Default Pad Properties…​**, or choose an existing pad to represent the
default by right clicking the pad and choosing **Copy Pad Properties to
Default**. New pads will use that pad’s properties as their defaults
until a new default is selected, either by editing another pad, editing
the default pad properties, or manually copying a different pad’s
properties to the default.

There are several ways to update existing pads with the properties of
other pads. You can apply the default pad properties to an explicit
selection of pads by selecting the desired target pads, right clicking,
and choosing **Paste Default Pad Properties to Selected** from the right
click context menu. You can also update other pads with a selected pad’s
properties using **Push Default Pad Properties to Other Pads…​**, also in
the right click context menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/push_pad_properties.png" alt="push pad properties" />
</figure>

This tool has several options to filter which pads are targeted.

If **do not modify pads having a different shape** is selected, only
pads with the exact same shape properties as the selected pad will be
updated.

If **do not modify pads having different layers** is selected, only pads
on the same layer(s) as the selected pad will be updated.

If **do not modify pads having a different orientation** is selected,
only pads with the same orientation as the selected pad will be updated.

If **do not modify pads pads having a different type** is selected, only
pads with the same pad type as the selected pad will be updated.

If no options are selected, all pads in the footprint will be updated.

You can create an array of pads from a source pad by right clicking the
source pad and selecting **Create from Selection** → **Create Array…​**
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+T</span>). The basic functionality of this
tool is described in the [PCB Editor documentation](#creating-arrays).
For pads, however, there are additional options for controlling pad
numbering.

<figure>
<img src="images/create_array_pads_grid.png"
alt="create array pads grid" />
</figure>

For grid arrays, you can select a numbering direction, either
**horizontal, then vertical** or **vertical, then horizontal**. If
**reverse numbering on alternate rows/columns** is selected, the
direction of increasing pad numbers will alternate from one row/column
to the next.

The initial pad number in the array can either be the first unused pad
number in the footprint (**use first free number**) or the specified
**pad numbering start** value. After the first number, the pad numbering
can either be **continuous** (1, 2, 3, …​) or **coordinate** based, in
other words, dependent on both the row and column (A1, A2, …​, B1, …​). In
addition to the initial pad number (**pad numbering start**), you can
specify a numbering step (**pad numbering skip**). For coordinate-based
numbering, you can configure separate starting numbers and steps for
each axis. You can select whether pad numbers use decimal digits (0-9),
hexadecimal digits (0-F), the full alphabet, or the alphabet excepting
certain ambiguous letters (I, O, S, Q, X, and Z).

Finally, you can quickly renumber existing pads using the Renumber Pads
tool (**Edit** → **Renumber Pads…​**).

<figure>
<img src="images/renumber_pads.png" alt="renumber pads" />
</figure>

The tool has several options. Pads will be renumbered starting at the
selected **first pad number**, and each subsequent pad will have its
number incremented by the **numbering step**. You can also choose an
optional **pad name prefix** which will be inserted before of the
incrementing part of each pad number.

Once you click **OK**, you will be prompted to click on a pad, which
will be assigned a new pad number based on the selected initial pad
number and prefix. You can keep clicking on pads to assign them the next
number in the sequence based on the selected numbering step. Double
click on a pad to renumber that pad and end the sequence, or press Esc
to discard the changes.

#### Custom pad shapes

For some footprints, the built-in pad shapes (round, rectangular, etc.)
may not be sufficient. In these cases you can construct custom pads with
arbitrary shapes using **Pad Edit Mode**. This mode lets you combine a
basic pad with graphic shapes to build a new pad out of the compound
shape.

To build a custom pad, first add a regular pad using the pad tool (![pad
24](images/icons/pad_24.png) button). This base pad will become the
custom pad’s anchor or snapping point, so be sure to place the pad in
the exact location where you want tracks to attach to the pad. The shape
and size of the pad do not matter, but the hole, if any, will remain in
the final custom pad. In other words, a surface mount base pad will
result in a surface mount custom pad, and a through hole base pad will
result in a through hole custom pad. The custom pad’s number will be
inherited from the base pad.

Next, enter Pad Edit Mode by selecting the base pad, right-clicking, and
selecting **Edit Pad as Graphic Shapes**
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+E</span>). Add graphic shapes as
appropriate to create the desired pad shape. Shapes touching the base
pad will be unioned together with the base pad to create the final pad
shape.

You can exit Pad Edit Mode by right-clicking and selecting **Finish Pad
Edit**, or pressing <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+E</span> again. When you
exit pad edit mode, all shapes that touch the base pad will be combined
with the pad. For example, when editing a surface mount pad on `F.Cu`,
any shapes that are on `F.Cu` and touch the base pad will become part of
the custom pad. Any shapes that do not overlap the base pad, or that are
on a different layer, will remain separate. If the base pad is a through
hole pad, overlapping shapes on `F.Cu` will be combined in the custom
pad. Because through hole pads have the same pad shape on all copper
layers, this shape will become part of the custom pad on all copper
layers, not just `F.Cu`. For convenience, Pad Edit Mode dims the color
of other pads and all shapes that are not contiguous with the base pad
so that you can see which shapes will be included in the custom pad and
which will not.

Custom pads can only contain a single base pad. Any additional pads that
touch the base pad or the contiguous graphics, whether they have the
same or different pad numbers as the base pad, will remain separate pads
after the shapes are combined into the custom pad.

<div class="note">

If you would like to add multiple anchors (snapping points) to a custom
pad, you can add additional separate pads on top of the custom pad.
Create the custom pad as normal, containing the first snapping point,
then add additional pads with the same number and place them overlapping
the custom pad in the desired snapping locations. They will remain
distinct pads and will not be combined with the custom pad, but they
will act as additional pad anchors and will be electrically connected to
the custom pad.

</div>

To modify an existing custom pad, select it and enter Pad Edit Mode
again. You can then continue to edit the component shapes to adjust the
pad shape, or change the position of the base pad to adjust the pad
anchor.

KiCad automatically chooses a size and location for showing the pad
number over the pad. Particularly for unusually shaped pads, the
automatically determined size and location may not be optimal. In these
cases, you can manually specify a region in which KiCad should draw the
pad number by adding a pad **number box** primitive. To add a number
box, enter Pad Edit Mode and add a rectangular shape. In the Properties
Manager for the rectangle, check the **Number Box** checkbox. The
rectangle will then be shown as a wireframe, and when you exit Pad Edit
Mode it will be used to draw the pad number.

In the board, KiCad will automatically add thermal spokes when
connecting the pad to a zone. The thermal spoke settings are determined
by the pad, footprint, and zone settings, and the thermal spokes by
default connect to the pad anchor. You can override the default thermal
spoke placement by adding **thermal relief templates** to the custom
pad. To add a thermal relief template, enter Pad Edit Mode and add a
line shape. In the Properties Manager for the line, check the **Thermal
Relief Template** checkbox. In Pad Edit Mode, the line will then be
shown as a wireframe, and it will not be shown outside of pad edit mode.
If any thermal relief templates are present in the pad, KiCad will not
automatically add additional spokes when filling zones; spokes will only
be placed where there are thermal relief templates defined in the pad.
Thermal relief templates only determine the spoke location: spoke width
and relief gap are still defined in the pad, footprint, and/or zone
properties, as normal.

### Footprint graphics and text

Footprints can contain graphic shapes, text, and dimensions. These
objects can be placed on nonphysical layers, like `F.Fab` or
`User.Drawings`, or they can be placed on layers that will be part of
the manufactured circuit board, such as `Edge.Cuts` or a silkscreen,
soldermask, or copper layer. Objects on copper layers can make
electrical connections.

Closed shapes on a footprint’s `F.Courtyard` and `B.Courtyard` layers
will form the footprint’s front and back courtyard, respectively. A
courtyard defines the physical extents of a footprint and limits where
footprints are allowed to be placed in relation to other footprints. If
a footprint’s courtyard overlaps another footprint’s courtyard, a DRC
violation will be generated.

Shapes on a footprint’s `Edge.Cuts` layer will correspond to board edges
on any PCB that includes the footprint. Closed shapes will result in
cutouts, while unclosed shapes will result in unclosed edges. Unclosed
edges must be closed in the full board design.

The buttons on the right toolbar can be used to create:

- Lines (![add line 24](images/icons/add_line_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+L</span>)

- Arcs (![add arc 24](images/icons/add_arc_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+A</span>)

- Bezier curves (![add bezier 24](images/icons/add_bezier_24.png),
  default hotkey <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+B</span>)

- Rectangles (![add rectangle 24](images/icons/add_rectangle_24.png))

- Circles (![add circle 24](images/icons/add_circle_24.png), default
  hotkey <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+C</span>)

- Polygons (![add graphical polygon
  24](images/icons/add_graphical_polygon_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+P</span>)

- Text (![text 24](images/icons/text_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+T</span>)

- Textboxes (![add textbox 24](images/icons/add_textbox_24.png))

- Tables (![table 24](images/icons/table_24.png))

- Dimensions (![add aligned dimension
  24](images/icons/add_aligned_dimension_24.png)), of which several
  types are available

<div class="note">

You can customize the default style of newly-created text and shape
objects in **Preferences** → **Footprint Editor** → **Default Values**.

</div>

Graphical objects and their properties are described in more detail in
the [PCB Editor documentation](#pcb-graphical-objects).

#### Bulk editing footprint text and graphics

Properties of text and graphics can be edited in bulk using the **Edit
Text and Graphics Properties** dialog (**Edit** → **Edit Text & Graphic
Properties…​**).

<figure>
<img src="images/edit_text_and_graphics_properties_footprint.png"
alt="edit text and graphics properties footprint" />
</figure>

This dialog is described in more detail in the [PCB Editor
documentation](#pcbnew-edit-text-and-graphics-properties).

#### Cleaning up footprint graphics

There is a dedicated tool for performing common cleanup operations on
graphics, which is run via **Tools** → **Cleanup Graphics…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/cleanup_graphics_footprint.png"
alt="cleanup graphics footprint" />
</figure>

The following cleanup actions are available and will be performed when
selected:

**Merge lines into rectangles:** combines individual graphic lines that
together form a rectangle into a single rectangle shape object.

**Delete redundant graphics:** deletes graphics objects that are
duplicated or degenerate.

**Merge overlapping graphics into pads:** merges graphic copper shapes
that overlap pads into a [custom pad](#custom-pad-shapes).

Any changes that will be applied to the footprint are displayed at the
bottom of the dialog. They are not applied until you press the **Update
Footprint** button.

### Rule areas

Rule areas, also known as keepouts, are footprint regions that can have
specific DRC rules defined for them. Some basic rules are available that
will raise DRC errors if certain types of objects are within the bounds
of the rule area, but rule areas can also be used together with [custom
DRC rules](#custom-design-rules) to define complex DRC behavior that
only applies within the rule area. A rule area in a footprint takes
effect when the footprint is added to the board.

You can add a rule area by clicking the ![add keepout area
24](images/icons/add_keepout_area_24.png) button on the right toolbar
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+K</span>). Click on the canvas to
place the first corner, which will show the Rule Area Properties dialog.
After configuring the rule area appropriately, press **OK** to continue
placing corners of the rule area. The rule area shape can be an
arbitrary polygon; click on the starting corner or double click to
finish placing the rule area.

Rule areas are described in more detail in the [PCB
editor](#pcb-rule-areas) documentation.

### Reference images

Just like in the PCB Editor, you can use reference images in the
Footprint Editor to assist with your footprint designs. Footprint
reference images are only shown in the Footprint Editor: they are not
shown in the PCB Editor when a footprint is added to a board, and they
do not appear in any fabrication outputs.

To add a reference image, use the ![image 24](images/icons/image_24.png)
button on the right toolbar and select the desired reference image file.

Reference images are described in more detail in the [PCB Editor
documentation](#pcb-reference-images).

### Footprint wizards

KiCad provides a set of footprint wizards that can be used to create
some common kinds of footprints based on a set of parameters. Wizards
for the following types of footprints are provided:

- BGA packages

- QFN packages

- QFP packages

- SOIC, MSOP, SSOP, TSSOP, etc. packages

- SIP and DIP packages

- ZIP packages

- ZOIC packages

- FPC connectors

- Micromatch SMD connectors

- Circular pad arrays

- Touch sliders

- Mutual capacitance touch buttons

- USS-39 barcodes

- QR codes

To create a footprint using a footprint wizard, click the ![module
wizard 24](images/icons/module_wizard_24.png) button and choose a
footprint type from the list that appears.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_wizard.png" alt="footprint wizard" />
</figure>

In the window that appears, fill out the parameters as appropriate. When
the parameters are correctly filled out, press the ![export footprint
names 24](images/icons/export_footprint_names_24.png) button to transfer
the generated footprint back into the footprint editor. Then you can
make additional manual modifications and save the footprint as normal.

In addition to the set of footprint wizards that KiCad provides, you can
also create your own. For more information about creating new footprint
wizards, see the [Scripting section](#creating-footprint-wizards) of the
Advanced Topics chapter.

### Checking footprints

The Footprint Editor can check for common issues in your footprints. Run
the footprint checker using the ![erc 24](images/icons/erc_24.png)
button in the top toolbar.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_checker.png" alt="footprint checker" />
</figure>

Any footprint issues that are detected are listed in the dialog and
displayed with arrow indicators in the editing canvas. Clicking on an
issue in the dialog will focus on the issue in the canvas.

The footprint checker checks for:

- Malformed or missing courtyards

- Pads that don’t match the footprint’s type: footprints without any
  through hole pads should be set to the surface mount footprint type

- Through hole pads without a hole

- Plated through hole pads not on any copper layers

- Plated through hole pads without a copper annulus

- Plated through hole pads with a hole that isn’t fully within the pad

- Surface mount pads on both the front and back

- Surface mount pads with mismatched copper and paste/mask layers (front
  copper and back paste/mask, or vice versa)

- Pads co-located with or too close to other holes

- Collisions between silkscreen and solder mask openings

- Pads that short to other pads outside of net tie groups

- Nonexistent pads in net tie groups

- Pads in that appear in multiple net tie groups

## Browsing footprint libraries

The Footprint Library Browser allows you to quickly examine the contents
of footprint libraries. The Footprint Library Viewer can be accessed by
clicking ![Library viewer icon](images/icons/library_browser_24.png)
icon on the main Board Editor toolbar or with **View** → **Footprint
Library Browser**.

To examine the contents of a library, select a library from the list in
the left hand pane. All footprints in the selected library will appear
in the second pane. Select a footprint name to view the footprint.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_library_browser.png" style="width:95.0%"
alt="Footprint Library Browser" />
</figure>

Double clicking the name of a footprint or using the ![Insert footprint
in board icon](images/icons/insert_module_board_24.png) button adds the
footprint to the board.

The top toolbar contains the following commands:

|                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                  |

## Configuration and Customization

The KiCad PCB Editor has a variety of preferences that can be configured
through the Preferences dialog. Like all parts of KiCad, the preferences
for the PCB Editor are stored in the user configuration directory and
are independent between KiCad minor versions to allow multiple versions
to run side-by-side with independent preferences.

The first sections of the Preferences dialog (Common, Mouse and
Touchpad, and Hotkeys) are shared between all KiCad programs. These
sections are described in detail in the KiCad manual under the "Common
preferences" section.

### Display options

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_preferences_display.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="pcbnew preferences display" />
</figure>

**Rendering Engine:** Controls if Accelerated graphics or Fallback
graphics are used.

**Grid style:** Controls how the alignment grid is drawn.

**Grid thickness:** Controls how thick grid lines or dots are drawn.

**Min grid spacing:** Controls the minimum distance, in pixels, between
two grid lines. Grid lines that violate this minimum spacing will not be
drawn, regardless of the current grid setting.

**Snap to grid:** Controls when drawing and editing operations will be
snapped to coordinates on the active grid. "Always" will enable snapping
even when the grid is hidden; "When grid shown" will enable snapping
only when the grid is visible.

<div class="note">

Grid snapping can be temporarily disabled by holding down Ctrl.

</div>

**Cursor shape:** Controls whether the editing cursor is drawn as a
small crosshair or a full-screen crosshair (a set of lines covering the
entire drawing canvas). The editing cursor shows where the next drawing
or editing action will occur and will be snapped to a grid location if
snapping is enabled.

**Always show crosshairs:** Controls whether the editing cursor is shown
all the time or only when an editing or drawing tool is active.

**Net names:** Controls whether or not net name labels are drawn on
copper objects. These labels are guides for editing only and do not
appear in fabrication outputs.

**Show pad numbers:** Controls whether or not pad number labels are
drawn on footprint pads.

**Show pad \<no net\> indicator:** Controls whether or not pads with no
net are indicated with a special marker.

**Track clearance:** Controls whether or not clearance outlines around
tracks and vias are shown. Clearance outlines are shown as thin shapes
around objects that indicate the minimum clearance to other objects, as
defined by constraints and design rules.

**Show pad clearance:** Controls whether or not clearance outlines
around pads are shown.

**Center view on cross-probed items:** When the Schematic and PCB
Editors are both running, controls whether clicking a component or pin
in Eeschema will center the PCB Editor view on the corresponding
footprint or pad.

**Zoom to fit cross-probed items:** Controls whether the view will be
zoomed to show a cross-probed footprint or pad.

**Highlight cross-probed nets:** Controls whether or not nets
highlighted in Eeschema will be highlighted in the PCB Editor when the
highlight tool is activated in both tools.

### Editing options

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_preferences_editing.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="pcbnew preferences editing" />
</figure>

**Flip board items L/R:** Controls the direction board items will be
flipped when moving them between the top and bottom layers. When
checked, items are flipped Left-to-Right (about the Vertical axis); when
unchecked, items are flipped Top-to-Bottom (about the Horizontal axis).

**Step for rotate commands:** Controls how far the selected object(s)
will be rotated each time the Rotate command is used.

**Allow free pads:** Controls whether or not the pads of footprints can
be unlocked and edited or moved separately from the footprint.

**Magnetic points:** This section controls object snapping, also called
magnetic points. Object snapping takes precedence over grid snapping
when it is enabled. Object snapping only works to objects on the active
layer. Hold Shift to temporarily disable object snapping.

**Snap to pads:** Controls when the editing cursor will snap to pad
origins.

**Snap to tracks:** Controls when the editing cursor will snap to track
segment endpoints.

**Snap to graphics:** Controls when the editing cursor will snap to
graphic shape points.

**Always show selected ratsnest:** When enabled, the ratsnest for a
selected footprint will always be shown even if the global ratsnest is
hidden.

**Show ratsnest with curved lines:** Controls whether ratsnest lines are
drawn straight or curved.

**Mouse drag track behavior:** Controls the action that will occur when
you drag a track segment with the mouse: "Move" will move the track
segment independent of any others. "Drag (45 degree mode)" will invoke
the push-and-shove router to drag the track, respecting design rules and
keeping other track segments attached. "Drag (free angle)" will move the
nearest corner of the track segment, highlighting collisions with other
objects but not moving them out of the way.

**Limit actions to 45 degrees from start** Controls whether lines drawn
with the graphic drawing tools can take on any angle. Note that this
only affects drawing new lines: lines can be edited to take on any
angle.

**Show page limits:** Controls whether or not the page boundary is drawn
as a rectangle.

**Refill zones after Zone Properties dialog:** Controls whether or not
zones are automatically refilled after editing the properties of any
zone. This may be disabled on complicated designs or slower computers to
improve responsiveness.

### Colors

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_preferences_colors.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="pcbnew preferences colors" />
</figure>

KiCad supports switching between different color themes to match your
preferences. Kicad 9.0 comes with two built-in color themes: "KiCad
Default" is a new theme designed to have good contrast and balance for
most cases and is the default for new installations. "KiCad Classic" is
the default theme from KiCad 5.1 and earlier versions. Neither of these
built-in themes can be modified, but you can create new themes to
customize the look of KiCad as well as install themes made by other
users.

Color themes are stored in JSON files located in the `colors`
subdirectory of the KiCad configuration directory. The "Open Theme
Folder" button will open this location in your system file manager,
making it easy to manage your installed themes. To install a new theme,
place it in this folder and restart KiCad. The new theme will be
available from the drop-down list of color themes if the file is a valid
color theme file.

To create a new color theme, choose New Theme…​ from the drop-down list
of color themes. Enter a name for your theme and then begin editing
colors. The colors in the new theme will be copied from whatever theme
was selected before you created the new theme.

To change a color, double-click or middle-click the color swatch in the
list. The "Reset to Default" button will reset that color to its
corresponding entry in the "KiCad Default" color theme.

Color themes are saved automatically; all changes are reflected
immediately when you close the Preferences dialog. The window on the
right side of the dialog shows a preview of how the selected theme will
look.

### Action plugins

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_preferences_action_plugins.png"
style="width:50.0%" alt="pcbnew preferences action plugins" />
</figure>

The KiCad PCB editor supports plugins written in Python that can perform
actions on the board being edited. These plugins can be installed using
the built-in Plugin and Content Manager (see the KiCad chapter for
details) or by placing the plugin files inside the user plugins
directory. See the Scripting section below for details.

Each plugin that is detected will be shown in a row on this preferences
page. Plugins may show a button on the top toolbar of the PCB editor. If
the "Show button" control is unchecked for a plugin, it may still be
accessed from the Tools \> External Plugins menu.

The arrow controls at the bottom of the list allow changing the order
that the plugins appear in the toolbar and menu. The folder button will
launch a file explorer to the plugin folder, to make installing new
plugins easier. The refresh button will scan the plugin folder for any
new or removed plugins and update the list.

### Origin & axes

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_preferences_origin_axes.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="pcbnew preferences origin axes" />
</figure>

**Display origin:** Determines which coordinate origin is used for
coordinate display in the editing canvas. The page origin is fixed at
the corner of the page. The drill/place file origin and the grid origin
can be moved by the user.

**X axis:** Controls whether X-coordinates increase to the right or to
the left.

**Y axis:** Controls whether Y-coordinates increase upwards or
downwards.

## Text variables

KiCad supports text variables, which allow you to substitute the
variable name with a defined text string. This substitution happens
anywhere the variable name is used inside the variable replacement
syntax of `${VARIABLENAME}`.

You can define project text variables in the
[schematic](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#schematic-setup-text-variables) or
[board setup](#board-setup-text-variables) dialogs. Project text
variables are defined for the whole project, so a project text variable
defined in the Schematic Editor can also be used in the Board Editor.

There are also a number of built-in system text variables. System text
variables may be available in some contexts and not others. The
following variables can be used in PCB text, footprint text, footprint
fields, and drawing sheet fields. There are also a number of [variables
that can be used in the Schematic
Editor](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#text-variables).

## <span id="custom_design_rules"></span>Custom design rules

KiCad’s custom design rule system allows creating design rules that are
more specific than the generic rules available in the Constraints page
of the Board Setup dialog. Custom design rules have many applications,
but in general they are used to apply certain rules to a portion of the
board, such as a specific net or net class, a specific area, or a
specific footprint.

Custom design rules are stored in a separate file with the extension
`kicad_dru`. This file is created automatically when you start adding
custom rules to a project. If you are using custom rules in your
project, make sure to save the `kicad_dru` file along with the
`kicad_pcb` and `kicad_pro` files when making backups or committing to a
version control system.

<div class="note">

The `kicad_dru` file is managed automatically by KiCad and should not be
edited with an external text editor. Always use the Custom Rules page of
the Board Setup dialog to edit custom design rules.

</div>

### The Custom Rules editor

The custom rules editor is located in the Board Setup dialog and
provides a text editor for entering custom rules, a syntax checker that
will test your custom rules and note any errors, and a syntax help
dialog that contains a quick reference to the custom rules language and
some example rules.

The custom rules editor also provides context-sensitive autocomplete to
suggest valid keywords and properties. The autocomplete suggestion menu
appears automatically, but it can also be opened manually by pressing
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Space</span>.

It is a good idea to use the **Check rule syntax** button after editing
custom rules to make sure there are no syntax errors. Any errors in the
custom rules will prevent the design rule checker from running.

### Custom rule syntax

The custom design rule language is based on s-expressions and allows you
to create design constraints that are not possible with the built-in
constraints. Each design rule generally contains a **condition**
defining what objects to match and a **constraint** defining the rule to
be applied to the matched objects.

The language uses parentheses (`(` and `)`) to define clauses of related
keywords and values. Parentheses must always be matched: for every `(`
there must be a matching `)`. Inside a clause, keywords and values are
separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newlines). By convention, a
single space is used, but any number of whitespace characters between
keywords and values is acceptable. In places where text strings are
valid, strings without any whitespace may be quoted with `"` or `'`, or
unquoted. Strings that contain whitespace must always be quoted.
Newlines cannot be used within a quoted string. Where nested quotes are
required, a single level of nesting is possible by using `"` for the
outer quote character and `'` for the inner (or vice versa). Newlines
between clauses are not required, but are typically used in examples for
clarity.

In the syntax descriptions below, items in `<angle brackets>` represent
keywords or values that must be present and items in `[square brackets]`
represent keywords or values that are optional or only sometimes
required.

The Custom Rules file must start with a version header defining the
version of the rules language. As of KiCad 9.0, the version is `1`. The
syntax of the version header is `(version <number>)`. So in KiCad 9.0
the header should read:

    (version 1)

After the version header, you can enter any number of rules. Rules are
evaluated in reverse order, meaning the last rule in the file is checked
first. Once a matching rule is found for a given set objects being
tested, no further rules will be checked. In practice, this means that
more specific rules should be later in the file, so that they are
evaluated before more general rules.

For example, if you create one rule that limits the minimum clearance
between tracks in the net `HV` and tracks in any other net and a second
rule that limits the minimum clearance for all objects inside a certain
rule area, make sure the first rule appears later in the custom rules
file than the second rule. Otherwise tracks in the `HV` net could have
the wrong clearance if they fall inside the rule area.

Each rule must have a name and one or more `constraint` clauses. The
name can be any string and is used to refer to the rule in DRC reports.
The `constraint` defines the behavior of the rule. Rules may also have a
`condition` clause that determines which objects should have the rule
applied, an optional `layer` clause which specifies which board layers
the rule applies to, and an optional `severity` clause which specifies
the severity of the resulting DRC violation.

    (rule <name>
        [(severity <severity>)]
        [(layer <layer_name>)]
        [(condition <expression>)]
        (constraint <constraint_type> [constraint_arguments]))

The custom rules file may also include comments to describe rules.
Comments are denoted by any line that begins with the `#` character (not
including whitespace). You can press
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+/</span> to comment or uncomment lines
automatically.

    # Clearance for 400V nets to anything else
    (rule HV
        (condition "A.hasNetclass('HV')")
        (constraint clearance (min 1.5mm)))

#### Layer Clause

The `layer` clause determines which layers the rule will work on. While
the layer of objects can be tested in the `condition` clause as
described below, using the `layer` clause is more efficient.

The value in the `layer` clause can be any board layer name, or the
shortcut keywords `outer` to match the front and back copper layers
(`F.Cu` and `B.Cu`) and `inner` to match any internal copper layers.

If the `layer` clause is omitted, the rule will apply to all layers.

Some examples:

    # Do not allow footprints on back layer (no condition clause means this rule always applies)
    (rule "Top side footprints only"
        (layer B.Cu)
        (constraint disallow footprint))

    # This rule does the same thing, but is less efficient
    (rule "Top side footprints only"
        (condition "A.Layer == 'B.Cu'")
        (constraint disallow footprint))

    # Larger clearance on outer layers (inner layer clearance set by board minimum clearance)
    (rule "clearance_outer"
        (layer outer)
        (constraint clearance (min 0.25mm)))

#### Severity Clause

The `severity` clause sets the DRC violation severity whenever the rule
is violated.

Possible values are `error`, `warning`, `ignore`, and `exclusion`.
Ignored rules are not observed by the interactive router and violations
are not shown in the DRC dialog. However, ignored rules are evaluated
for matching and therefore can still override earlier rules. Errors,
warnings, and excluded rules are all observed by the interactive router,
and violations are displayed in the DRC dialog when the appropriate
filters are selected.

<div class="warning">

Setting a rule’s severity to `ignore` does not disable the rule; only
the effects of the rule are disabled. The rule is still evaluated and
can still override previous rules.

</div>

#### Condition Clauses

The `condition` clause determines which objects which objects the rule
applies to. If a rule has a condition clause, the rule will apply to any
objects that match the condition. If a rule does not have any condition
clauses, it will apply unconditionally.

The rule **condition** is an expression contained inside a text string
(and therefore usually surrounded by quotes in order to allow whitespace
for clarity). The expression is evaluated against each pair of objects
that is being tested by the design rule checker. For example, when
checking for clearance between copper objects, each copper object (track
segment, pad, via, etc.) on each net is checked against other copper
objects on other nets. If a custom rule exists where the expression
matches the two given copper objects and the constraint defines a copper
clearance, this custom rule could be used to determine the required
clearance between the two objects.

The objects being tested are referred to as `A` and `B` in the
expression language. The order of the two objects is not important
because the design rule checker will test both possible orderings. For
example, you can write a rule that assumes that `A` is a track and `B`
is a via. There are some expression functions that test both objects
together; these use `AB` as the object name.

The expression in a condition must resolve to a boolean value (true or
false). If the expression resolves to true, the rule is applied to the
given objects.

Each object being tested has **properties** that can be compared, as
well as **functions** that can be used to perform certain tests. The
syntax for using properties and functions is `<object>.<property>` and
`<object>.<function>([arguments])` respectively.

<div class="note">

When you type `<object>.` in the text editor (`A.`, `B.`, or `AB.`), an
autocomplete list will open that contains all the object properties that
can be used.

</div>

The object properties and functions are compared using **boolean** and
**relational operators** to result in a boolean expression. The
following operators are supported:

|           |                                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `==`      | Equal to                               |
| `!=`      | Not equal to                           |
| `>`, `>=` | Greater than, greater than or equal to |
| `<`, `<=` | Less than, less than or equal to       |
| `&&`      | And                                    |
| `||`      | Or                                     |
| `!`       | Not (unary)                            |

For example, `A.NetName == 'VDD'` will apply to any objects that are
part of the "VDD" net and `A.NetName != B.NetName` will apply to any
objects that have different net names. Parentheses can be used to
clarify the order of operations in complex expressions but they are not
required. All the boolean operators have the same precedence and are
evaluated in order from left to right.

To test a boolean property, evaluate the property itself, without
comparing it to a boolean literal like `true` or `false` (which don’t
exist in the DRC rules language). For example, to test if a footprint’s
boolean `Do_not_populate` property is set, the boolean expression
`A.Do_not_populate` by itself is sufficient. It will resolve to a true
value if the footprint’s DNP attribute is set, and a false value
otherwise. To check if a boolean is false, use the `!` operator (unary
not): `!A.Do_not_populate` will resolve to a true value if the DNP
attribute is unset, and a false value otherwise.

Some properties represent a physical measurement, such as a size, angle,
length, position, etc. On these properties, **unit suffixes** can be
used in the custom rules language to specify what units are being used.
If no unit suffix is used, the internal representation of the property
will be used instead (nanometers for distances and degrees for most
angles). The following suffixes are supported:

|             |                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `mm`        | Millimeters                   |
| `mil`, `th` | Thousandths of an inch (mils) |
| `in`, `"`   | Inches                        |
| `deg`       | Degrees                       |
| `rad`       | Radians                       |

<div class="note">

The units used in custom design rules are independent of the display
units in the PCB editor.

</div>

Numeric conditions can use simple math expressions, for example
`(condition "A.Hole_Size_X == 1.0mm + 0.1mm")`.

#### Constraint Clauses

The `constraint` clause of the rule defines the behavior of the rule on
the objects that are matched by the condition. Each constraint clause
has a **constraint type** and one or more arguments that set the
behavior of the constraint. A single rule may have multiple constraint
clauses, in order to set multiple constraints (for example, `clearance`
and `track_width`) for objects that match the same rule conditions.

Many constraints take arguments that specify a physical measurement or
quantity. These constraints support minimum, optimal, and maximum value
specification (abbreviated "min/opt/max"). The **minimum** and
**maximum** values are used for design rule checking: if the actual
value is less than the minimum or is greater than the maximum value in
the constraint, a DRC error is created. The **optimal** value is only
used for some constraints, and informs KiCad of a "best" value to use by
default. For example, the optimal `diff_pair_gap` is used by the router
when placing new differential pairs. No errors will be created if the
differential pair is later modified such that the gap between the pair
is different from the optimal value, as long as the gap is between the
minimum and maximum values (if these are specified). In all cases where
a min/opt/max value is accepted, any or all of the minimum, optimal, and
maximum value can be specified.

Min/opt/max values are specified as `(min <value>)`, `(opt <value>)`,
and `(max <value>)`. For example, a track width constraint may be
written as
`(constraint track_width (min 0.5mm) (opt 0.5mm) (max 1.0mm))` or simply
`(constraint track_width (min 0.5mm))` if only the minimum width is to
be constrained.

Numeric constraint values can use simple math expressions, for example
`(constraint clearance (min 0.5mm + 0.1mm))`.

#### Common Properties

These properties apply to all PCB objects.

| `Position_X` | dimension | The position of the object’s origin in the X-axis. Note that the origin of an object is not always the same as the center of the object’s bounding box. For example, the origin of a footprint is the location of the (0, 0) coordinate of that footprint in the footprint editor, but the footprint may have been designed such that this location is not in the center of the courtyard shape. |
| `Position_Y` | dimension | The position of the object’s origin in the Y-axis. Note that KiCad always uses Y-coordinates that increase from the top to bottom of the screen internally, even if you have configured your settings to show the Y-coordinates increasing from bottom to top.                                                                                                                                   |

with better performance, for example <code>A.Net == B.Net</code> is
faster than <code>A.NetName == B.NetName</code>.</p></td>

copper object. This is a priority ordered, comma delimited list where a

<p>Note that this list may include the <code>Default</code> net class,
even if other net classes have been explicitly assigned to the net,
because the <code>Default</code> net class provides fallback properties
and design rules for any properties not defined by explicit net classes.
See the <a href="#board-setup-net-classes">net class documentation</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>In an expression, an object’s <code>NetClass</code> property and a
net class string are equal to each other if the string matches any of
the net classes in the list, or if the string matches the full ordered
list. For example, if an object belongs to the <code>HV</code> and
<code>Default</code> net classes, all of the following expressions are
true:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>A.NetClass == 'HV'</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>A.NetClass == 'Default'</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>A.NetClass == 'LV,Default'</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>A.NetClass == 'Default,HV'</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also check if a copper object is a member of a particular net
class, regardless of any other net classes it may be a part of, using
<code>hasNetclass(&lt;netclass&gt;)</code>. You can check if a copper
object’s net classes exactly match a given list of net classes using

matches any of the component classes in the list, or if the string

<p>Note that while <code>Component_Class</code> is a footprint property,
footprint children, such as pads or graphics, are considered to be
members of any component class that their parent footprint is a member
of. For example, if a footprint is has the component class
<code>HV</code>, the condition <code>A.Component_Class == 'HV'</code> is
true both for the footprint as well as for its pads and other
children.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;"><p>Returns true if the set of component
classes assigned to the object contains the named component class

that has a specific component class. For this query, see the

or <code>inDiffPair('/USB')</code> both return <code>true</code> for
objects in the nets <code>/USB_P</code> and <code>/USB_N</code>.
<code>*</code> and <code>?</code> can be used as wildcards, so
<code>inDiffPair('/USB*')</code> matches <code>/USB1_P</code> and
<code>/USB1_N</code> as well as <code>/USB2_P</code> and
<code>/USB2_N</code>. Note this will always return false if the given
net is not a diff pair, meaning that there isn’t a matching net of the
opposite polarity. So, on a board with a net named <code>/USB_P</code>
but no net named <code>/USB_N</code>, this function returns
false.</p></td>

## Scripting

Scripting allows you to automate tasks within KiCad using the
[Python](https://www.python.org/) language. KiCad provides an API for
editing PCBs that can be used interactively or in standalone scripts.
Board Editor scripts can be organized as "action plugins", which are
displayed as icons in the top toolbar of the Board Editor. There is also
a separate Footprint Wizard API that can be used to create footprint
creation plugins for the Footprint Editor.

This manual covers general scripting concepts for the Board Editor’s
`pcbnew` API as well as for the footprint wizard API. Users wishing to
write or modify scripts should also use the Doxygen documentation for
these APIs located at
<https://docs.kicad.org/doxygen-python-nightly/namespaces.html>.

KiCad 6 or newer requires Python 3 for scripting support. Python 2 is no
longer supported.

### Using the scripting console

The PCB Editor comes with a built-in Python console that can be used to
inspect and interact with the board. To launch the console, use the
![Scripting console icon](images/icons/py_script_24.png) button in the
top toolbar. The PCB Editor Python API is not automatically loaded, so
to load it, type `import pcbnew` into the console. The command
`pcbnew.GetBoard()` will then return a reference to the board currently
loaded in the PCB Editor, which can be inspected and modified through
the console.

### Python script locations

Plugin scripts (PCB action plugins and footprint wizards) can be
installed automatically using the Plugin and Content Manager (PCM), or
manually by copying the plugin to a folder. Manually installed plugins
should each be in their own folder within the `plugins` folder. The
location of the `plugins` folder is by default:

| Platform | Path                                           |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Linx     | `~/.local/share/kicad/9.0/scripting/plugins`   |
| macOS    | `~/Documents/KiCad/9.0/scripting/plugins`      |
| Windows  | `%HOME%\Documents\KiCad\9.0\scripting\plugins` |

<div class="note">

The type of plugin is determined by the Python class it inherits from.
Inheriting from `FootprintWizardBase.FootprintWizard` will create a
footprint wizard plugin, and inheriting from `pcbnew.ActionPlugin` will
create an action plugin. Creating action plugins and footprint wizards
is described in more detail below.

</div>

### `pcbnew` API overview

The scripting API reflects the internal object structure inside KiCad’s
Board Editor. It is provided by the `pcbnew` module in Python.

<div class="note">

Because the API is tightly coupled to KiCad’s internals, the API will
change over time and is not considered stable. Consult the [doxygen
documentation](https://docs.kicad.org/doxygen-python-nightly/namespaces.html)
for the most up-to-date API reference, and be sure to use the
documentation for the appropriate version of KiCad.

</div>

Scripts, action plugins, and interactive scripting sessions often start
with a call to `GetBoard()`, which returns a `BOARD` object representing
the currently open board and its contents.

`BOARD` has a set of properties and a set for each type of object in the
board: footprints, zones, tracks, vias, text, etc. Each type of object
has its own properties and holds its own objects: a footprint will
likely have at least one pad, for example.

The objects in the `BOARD` can be accessed using methods that each
return an iterable list of the corresponding object type. A selection of
these methods are listed below. Other methods are listed in the doxygen
documentation.

- `board.GetFootprints()`: returns a list of all of the footprints in
  the board.

- `board.GetDrawings()`: returns a list of miscellaneous board objects
  in the board.

- `board.GetTracks()`: returns a list of all of the tracks and vias in
  the board.

- `board.GetZones()`: returns a list of all of the zones in the board.

- `board.GetNetClasses():` returns a list of all net classes in the
  board’s design rules.

Boards can be loaded and saved from disk using the following functions:

- `LoadBoard(filename)`: loads a board from file, returning a `BOARD`
  object, using the file format that matches the filename extension.

- `SaveBoard(filename, board)`: saves a `BOARD` object to file, using
  the file format that matches the filename extension.

- `board.Save(filename)`: the same as `SaveBoard()`, but a method of the
  `BOARD` object.

### Action plugins

Action plugin associate a script with a button in the PCB Editor GUI.
Clicking the button runs the script. Action plugins are shown in the
**Tools** → **External plugins** menu, and can also be shown in the
toolbar if enabled in the **Action Plugins** page of the **Preferences**
dialog.

The example below is an action plugin that uses KiCad’s `pcbnew` API to
replace the string `$date$` with the current date in any text item.

``` python
import pcbnew
import re
import datetime

class text_by_date(pcbnew.ActionPlugin):
    """
    test_by_date: A sample plugin as an example of ActionPlugin
    Add the date to any text field of the board containing '$date$'
    How to use:
    - Add a text on your board with the content '$date$'
    - Call the plugin
    - The text will automatically be updated with the date (format YYYY-MM-DD)
    """

    def defaults(self):
        """
        Method defaults must be redefined
        self.name should be the menu label to use
        self.category should be the category (not yet used)
        self.description should be a comprehensive description
          of the plugin
        """
        self.name = "Add date on PCB"
        self.category = "Modify PCB"
        self.description = "Automatically add date on an existing PCB"

    def Run(self):
        pcb = pcbnew.GetBoard()
        for item in pcb.GetDrawings():
            if item.GetClass() == "PCB_TEXT":
                txt = re.sub("\$date\$ [0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}",
                                 "$date$", item.GetText())
                if txt == "$date$":
                    item.SetText("$date$ %s" % datetime.date.today())


text_by_date().register()
```

### Footprint wizards

Footprint wizards are Python scripts that can be accessed from the
Footprint Editor. Each footprint wizard presents a selection of
parameters defined in the Python script, and creates a footprint based
on the parameter values.

There are 3 minimum steps required to create a footprint wizard, which
are described below. For examples of how to create footprint wizards,
see the footprint wizards included with KiCad.

1.  Instantiate a Python class, inheriting from
    `FootprintWizardBase.FootprintWizard`.

2.  Define the 6 required functions: `GetName()`, `GetDescription()`,
    `GetValue()`, `GenerateParameterList()`, `CheckParameters()`, and
    `BuildThisFootprint()`.

3.  Register the class by calling `{your_class_name}().register()`.

The `GetName()`, `GetDescription()`, and `GetValue()` functions are
there to provide strings to the UI. The only functionality needed is to
return an appropriate string.

The `GenerateParameterList()` function defines the parameters needed for
the footprint. Parameters are grouped into a `page` + `name` format. For
example, calling `self.AddParam("demo", "radius", self.uMM, 5)` would
add a parameter named radius into the page named demo. Retrieving that
parameter data would be done with a call such as
`self.footprint_radius = self.parameters["demo"]["radius"]`.

The `CheckParameters()` function is available to perform any data
validation on the parameters defined in `GenerateParameterList()`. This
function is also where the
`self.footprint_radius = self.parameters["demo"]["radius"]` calls
reside.

The `BuildThisFootprint()` function is where the footprint building
steps are called. This function is where one creates the footprint.

The required `{your_class_name}().register()` call can either be at the
end of the Python file, or in an `__init__.py` file. Both styles are
supported by KiCad.

<div class="note">

KiCad will not reload a plugin after it has raised an error (for
example, the `NotImplementedError`). One will need completely close out
KiCad and restart it. However, this doesn’t apply to changes which do
not raise an error.

</div>

## IDF component outlines

KiCad can [export an IDF representation of the board](#idf-exporter) for
use in mechanical CAD software. Below is some guidance on attaching IDF
component outlines to footprints, creating new IDF component outlines,
and a description of the IDF utilities included with KiCad.

### Specifying component models for use by the exporter

IDF component models are attached to footprints using the [footprint’s
3D model properties](#footprint-3d-models). The IDF exporter uses
different filetypes than the 3D viewer and other 3D model exporters, so
adding 3D models for the IDF exporter does not conflict with 3D models
added to a footprint for other purposes.

To add an IDF model to a footprint in the footprint or PCB editors, edit
the footprint’s properties and click on the 3D Models tab.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_3d_model_options.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Footprint properties, 3D settings" />
</figure>

Click the ![folder icon](images/icons/small_folder_16.png) button and
select the **IDF (\*.idf;\*.IDF)** filetype filter. Browse to the
desired outline file.

<figure>
<img src="images/idf_select.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="IDF component outline selection" />
</figure>

Once the desired component outline file is selected, enter any necessary
values for the offset and rotation. The offsets must be specified using
the IDF board output units (mm or mils) and in the IDF coordinate
system, which is a right-hand coordinate system with +Z pointing towards
the viewer, +X to the viewer’s right, and +Y towards the upper edge of
the screen. The rotation must be in degrees; positive rotation is a
counter-clockwise rotation as described in the IDFv3 specification.

Multiple outlines may be combined with appropriate offsets to represent
simple assemblies such as a DIP package in a socket.

<div class="note">

Only the offset values and the Z rotation value are used by the IDF
exporter; all other values are ignored.

</div>

### Creating a component outline file

The component outline file (`*.idf`) consists of a single `.ELECTRICAL`
or `.MECHANICAL` section as described in the specification document. The
section may be preceded by any number of comment lines; the comment
lines are copied by the exporter into the library file and can be used
to track metadata such as references to the documents used to determine
the component’s outline and dimensions.

The component outline section contains fields which are strings,
integers, or floating point numbers. A string is a combination of
characters which may include spaces; if a string contains spaces then it
must be quoted. Quotation marks must not appear within a string.
Floating point numbers may be represented using decimal or exponential
notations but decimal notation is preferred for human readability. The
decimal point must be a dot and not a comma. The IDF file must consist
only of 7-bit ASCII characters; use of 8-bit characters will result in
undefined behavior.

An IDF file consists of SECTIONS which consist of RECORDS which consist
of FIELDS. For the IDF outline files only one type of section may exist
and must be one of `.ELECTRICAL` or `.MECHANICAL`. A record is a single
line of text and may contain one or more fields. Fields are sequences of
characters separated by one or more spaces which do not appear between
quotation marks. All fields of a record must appear on a single line;
records may not span lines.

The section heading (`.ELECTRICAL` or `.MECHANICAL`) is considered the
first record (Record 1) of the section. Record 1 must be followed by
Record 2 which has four fields:

1.  Geometry Name: a string which in combination with the Part Number
    must form a unique identifier for the component outline. For
    standardized packages, the package name is a good value for the
    geometry name, for example "SOT-23". For unique packages the
    manufacturer’s part number is a good choice for the geometry name.

2.  Part Number: although obviously intended for the part number, for
    example BS107, it is better to use this string to help describe the
    package. For example if the geometry name is "TO-92", the part
    number entry may be used to describe the layout of the pads or the
    orientation of this particular TO-92 outline file.

3.  IDF Unit: this must be one of `MM` or `THOU` and it applies only to
    the units describing this single component outline.

4.  Height: this is a floating point number representing the nominal
    height of the component using units specified in Field 3.

Record 2 must be followed by a number of Record 3 entries which specify
the outline of the component. Record 3 consists of four fields:

1.  Loop Index: `0` (outline points are specified in counter-clockwise
    order) or `1` (outline points are specified in clockwise order)

2.  X coordinate: a floating point number

3.  Y coordinate: a floating point number

4.  Included Angle: a floating point number. If the value is `0` then a
    straight line segment is drawn from the previous point to this
    point. If the value is `360` then the previous point specifies the
    center of a circle and this point specifies a point on the circle;
    never specify a circle using a value of `-360` as at least one major
    mechanical CAD package does not behave well in that situation. If
    the value is negative then a clockwise arc is drawn from the
    previous point to this point and if the value is positive then a
    counter-clockwise arc is drawn.

Only one closed loop is permitted and it is not possible to specify a
cutout. The last point specified must be the same as the first point
unless the outline is a circle.

Example IDF File 1:

    # a simple cylinder - this could represent an electrolytic capacitor
    .ELECTRICAL
        "cylinder" "5mm OD, 5mm height" MM 5
        0 0 0 0
        0 2.5 0 360
    .END_ELECTRICAL

Example IDF File 2:

    # an upside-down T
    # a comment added for the sake of adding comments
    .ELECTRICAL
        "Capital T" "5x8x10mm, upside down" MM 10
        0 -0.5 8 0
        0 -0.5 0.5 0
        0 -2.5 0.5 0
        0 -2.5 -0.5 180
        0 2.5 -0.5 0
        0 2.5 0.5 180
        0 0.5 0.5 0
        0 0.5 8 0
        0 -0.5 8 180
    .END_ELECTRICAL

### Guidelines for creating outlines

When creating outlines, and especially when sharing the work with
others, consistency in the design and naming of files helps people
locate files quicker and place the components with minimal hassles.

#### Package naming

Try to make some information about the outline available in the filename
to give the user a general idea of what the outline is. For example
axial leaded cylindrical packages may represent some types of capacitors
as well as some types of resistors, so it makes sense to identify an
outline as a horizontal or vertical axial leaded device and to add some
extra information on the relevant dimensions: diameter, length, and
pitch are the most important. If a device has a unique outline, the
manufacturer’s part number and a prefix to indicate the class of device
are adequate.

#### Comments

Use comments in the IDF file to give users more information about the
outline, for example a reference to the source used for dimensional
information.

#### Geometry and Part Number entries

Think carefully about the values to give to the Geometry and Part Number
entries. Taken together, these strings act as a unique identifier for
the MCAD system. The values of the strings will ideally have some
meaning to a user, but this is not necessary: the values are primarily
intended for the MCAD system to use as a unique ID. Ideally the values
chosen will be unique within any large collection of outlines; choosing
values well will result in fewer clashes especially in complex boards.

#### Pin orientation and positioning

Component outlines should be created to match the orientation and
position of the corresponding footprints. This avoids the need to
specify a non-zero rotation for the IDF component outline. Since the IDF
exporter ignores the (X, Y) offset values, it is vital that you use the
correct origin in the IDF component outline.

The image above shows sample outlines generated by the programs `idfcyl`
and `idfrect` and rendered in a mechanical CAD program. From left to
right are (a) vertical radial leaded cylinder, (b) vertical axial leaded
cylinder with wire on left, (c) vertical axial leaded cylinder with wire
on right, (d) horizontal axial leaded cylinder, (e) horizontal radial
leaded cylinder, (f) square outline, plain, (g) square outline with
chamfer, (h) square outline with axial lead on right. The top outlines
were specified in units of millimeters while the bottom outlines were
specified in units of inches.

#### Tips on dimensions

The purpose served by the extruded outlines is to give the mechanical
designer some idea of the location and physical space occupied by each
component. In a typical scenario the mechanical designer will replace
some of the crude outlines with more detailed mechanical models, for
example when checking to ensure that a right-angle mounted LED will fit
into a hole on a panel. In most situations the accuracy of an outline
doesn’t matter, but it is good practice to create outlines which convey
the best mechanical information possible. In a few instances a user may
wish to fit the component into a case with very little excess space, for
example in a portable music player. In such a situation, if most
extruded outlines are a good enough representation of components then
the mechanical designer may only have to replace very few models while
designing the case. If the outlines are not a reliable reflection of
reality then the mechanical designer will waste a lot of time replacing
models to ensure a good fit. After all, if you put garbage in you can
expect garbage to come out. If you put in good information, you can be
confident of good results.

### IDF Component Outline Tools

A number of command-line tools are available to help generate IDF
component outlines. The tools are:

1.  `idfcyl:` creates an outline of a cylinder in vertical or horizontal
    orientation and with axial or radial leads

2.  `idfrect:` creates an outline of a rectangle which may have either
    an axial lead or a chamfer in the top left corner

3.  `dxf2idf:` converts a drawing in DXF format into an IDF component
    outline

#### idfcyl

`idfcyl` generates outlines for cylindrical components.

When `idfcyl` is invoked with no arguments it prints out a usage note
and a summary of its inputs:

    idfcyl: This program generates an outline for a cylindrical component.
        The cylinder may be horizontal or vertical.
        A horizontal cylinder may have wires at one or both ends.
        A vertical cylinder may have at most one wire which may be
        placed on the left or right side.

    Input:
        Unit: mm, in (millimeters or inches)
        Orientation: V (vertical)
        Lead type: X, R (axial, radial)
        Diameter of body
        Length of body
        Board offset
        *   Wire diameter
        *   Pitch
        **  Wire side: L, R (left, right)
        *** Lead length
        File name (must end in *.idf)

        NOTES:
            *   only required for horizontal orientation or
                vertical orientation with axial leads

            **  only required for vertical orientation with axial leads

            *** only required for horizontal orientation with radial leads

The notes can be suppressed by entering any arbitrary argument on the
command line. A user can manually enter information at the command line
or create scripts to generate outlines. The following script creates a
single cylinder axial leaded outline with the lead on the right hand
side:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate a cylindrical IDF outline for test purposes
# vertical 5mm cylinder,  nominal length 8mm + 3mm board offset,
# axial wire on right,  0.8mm wire dia., 3.5mm pitch

#### idfrect

`idfrect` generates outlines for rectangular components.

When `idfrect` is invoked with no arguments it prints out a usage note
and a summary of its inputs:

    idfrect: This program generates an outline for a rectangular component.
        The component may have a single lead (axial) or a chamfer on the
        upper left corner.
    Input:
        Unit: mm, in (millimeters or inches)
        Width:
        Length:
        Height:
        Chamfer: length of the 45 deg. chamfer
        *  Leaded: Y,N (lead is always to the right)
        ** Wire diameter
        ** Pitch
        File name (must end in *.idf)

        NOTES:
            *   only required if chamfer = 0

            **  only required for leaded components

The notes can be suppressed by entering any arbitrary argument on the
command line. A user can manually enter information at the command line
or create scripts to generate outlines. The following script creates a
chamfered rectangle and an axial leaded outline:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate various rectangular IDF outlines for test purposes
# 10x10, 1mm chamfer, 2mm height
idfrect - 1 > /dev/null <<  _EOF

#### dxf2idf

`dxf2idf` creates an IDF component file from a DXF outline.

The DXF file used to specify the component outline can be prepared with
the free software [LibreCAD](http://librecad.org/) for best
compatibility.

When `dxf2idf` is invoked with no arguments it prints out a usage note
and a summary of its inputs:

    dxf2idf: this program takes line, arc, and circle segments
        from a DXF file and creates an IDF component outline file.

    Input:
        DXF filename: the input file, must end in '.dxf'
        Units: mm, in (millimeters or inches)
        Geometry Name: string, as per IDF version 3.0 specification
        Part Name: as per IDF version 3.0 specification of Part Number
        Height: extruded height of the outline
        Comments: all non-empty lines are comments to be added to
            the IDF file. An empty line signifies the end of
            the comment block.
        File name: output filename, must end in '.idf'

The notes can be suppressed by entering any arbitrary argument on the
command line. A user can manually enter information at the command line
or create scripts to generate outlines. The following script creates a
5mm high outline from a DXF file `test.dxf`:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate an IDF outlines from a DXF file
dxf2idf - 1 > /dev/null << _EOF
test.dxf

DXF TEST GEOMETRY
DXF TEST PART

This is an IDF test file produced from the outline 'test.dxf'
This is a second IDF comment to demonstrate multiple comments

```

#### idf2vrml

The `idf2vrml` tool reads a set of one IDF Board (`.emn`) and one IDF
Component file (`.emp`) and produces a VRML file which can be viewed
with a VRML viewer. This feature is useful for visualization of the
board assembly in cases where the user does not have access to MCAD
software. Invoking `idf2vrml` without any arguments will result in the
display of a usage message:

    >./idf2vrml
    Usage: idf2vrml -f input_file.emn -s scale_factor {-k} {-d} {-z} {-m}
    flags:
       -k: produce KiCad-friendly VRML output; default is compact VRML
       -d: suppress substitution of default outlines
       -z: suppress rendering of zero-height outlines
       -m: print object mapping to stdout for debugging purposes
    example to produce a model for use by KiCad: idf2vrml -f input.emn -s 0.3937008 -k

<div class="note">

The `idf2vrml` tool does not correctly render `OTHER_OUTLINE` entities
in an `emn` file if that entity is specified on the back layer of the
PCB; however you will not noticeable using files exported by KiCad
because there is no mechanism to specify such an entity. This is only an
issue if you render a third party emn file which does employ an entity
on the back side of a board.
