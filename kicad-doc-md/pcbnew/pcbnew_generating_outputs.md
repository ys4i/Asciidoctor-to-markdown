# Generating outputs

KiCad can generate and export files in a number of different formats
useful for manufacturing PCBs and interfacing with external software.
This functionality is available in the File menu in a few different
sections.

- The **Fabrication Outputs** section contains the most common
  operations needed to prepare a PCB for fabrication.

- The **Export** section contains tools for generating files that can be
  read by external software.

- The **Plot** function allows you to export 2D line drawings of the PCB
  in various formats.

- The **Print** function allows you to send a view of the PCB to a 2D
  printer.

## Fabrication outputs and plotting

KiCad uses Gerber files as its primary plotting format for PCB
manufacturing. To create Gerber files, open the **Plot…​** dialog from
the **File** menu, or select **Gerbers (.gbr)…​** from the **Fabrication
Outputs** section of the **File** menu. The Plot dialog will open,
allowing you to configure and generate Gerber files.

<figure>
<img src="images/plot_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="plot dialog" />
</figure>

The **Plot** button generates output files according to the selected
options. Messages from the plotting process are shown in the Output
Messages panel, and can be filtered by the checkboxes.

The **Generate Drill Files…​** button opens the [Generate Drill Files
dialog](#drill-files). **Run DRC…​** opens the [Design Rules
Checker](#design-rule-checking).

### Plotting options

- **Include Layers:** Check that every layer used on your board is
  enabled in the list. Disabled layers will not be plotted.

- **Plot on All Layers:** Selected layers will be included in the plot
  for each layer selected in the **include layers** list. The additional
  layers are plotted on top of the base layer. You can reorder these
  layers using the arrow buttons at the bottom; items that are lower in
  the list are plotted after (on top of) items that are higher in the
  list.

- **Output directory:** Specify the location to save plotted files. If
  this is a relative path, it is created relative to the project
  directory. Use the ![small new window
  16](images/icons/small_new_window_16.png) button to open the output
  directory in a file browser.

- **Plot drawing sheet:** If enabled, the drawing sheet border and title
  block will be plotted on each layer. This should usually be disabled
  when plotting Gerber files.

- **Subtract soldermask from silkscreen:** When enabled, silkscreen will
  be automatically removed from board areas that aren’t covered by
  soldermask.

- **Indicate DNP on fabrication layers:** If enabled, fabrication layers
  (`F.Fab` and `B.Fab`) will indicate when a footprint has the DNP (Do
  Not Populate) attribute set. DNP footprints are either not plotted on
  the fabrication layers (**Hide**) or are plotted with an X drawn
  through them on the front and back fabrication layer (**Cross-out**).

- **Sketch pads on fabrication layers:** If enabled, the outlines of
  footprint pads will be drawn on fabrication layers (`F.Fab` or
  `B.Fab`). If **Include pad numbers** is enabled, pad numbers will be
  drawn as well.

- **Drill marks:** For plot formats other than Gerber, marks may be
  plotted at the location of all drilled holes. Drill marks may be
  created at the actual size (diameter) of the finished hole, or at a
  smaller size.

- **Scaling:** For plot formats that support scaling other than 1:1, the
  plot scale may be set. The Auto scaling setting will scale the plot to
  fit the specified page size.

- **Use drill/place file origin:** When enabled, the coordinate origin
  for plotted files will be the drill/place file origin set in the board
  editor. When disabled, the coordinate origin will be the absolute
  origin (top left corner of the worksheet).

- **Mirrored plot:** For some plot formats, the output may be mirrored
  horizontally when this option is set.

- **Negative plot:** For some plot formats, the output may be set to
  negative mode. In this mode, shapes will be drawn for the empty space
  inside the board outline, and empty space will be left where objects
  are present in the PCB.

- **Check zone fills before plotting:** When enabled, zone fills will be
  checked (and refilled if outdated) before generating outputs. Plot
  outputs may be incorrect if this option is disabled!

<div class="note">

Versions of KiCad before 9.0 had a global control for tenting vias while
plotting. In KiCad 9.0, via tenting is globally controlled in [Board
Setup](#board-setup), and can be overridden in the [properties
dialog](#track-and-via-properties) for each via.

</div>

### Gerber options

- **Use Protel filename extensions:** When enabled, the plotted Gerber
  files will be named with file extensions based on Protel (`.GBL`,
  `.GTL`, etc). When disabled, the files will have the `.gbr` extension.

- **Generate Gerber job file:** When enabled, a Gerber job file
  (`.gbrjob`) will be generated along with any Gerber files. The Gerber
  job file is an extension to the Gerber format that includes
  information about the PCB stackup, materials, and finish. More
  information about Gerber job files is available at [the Ucamco
  website](https://www.ucamco.com/en/gerber/gerber-job-file).

- **Coordinate format:** Configure how coordinates will be stored in the
  plotted Gerber files. Check with your manufacturer for their
  recommended setting for this option.

- **Use extended X2 format:** When enabled, the plotted Gerber files
  will use the X2 format, which includes information about the netlist
  and other extended attributes. This format may not be compatible with
  older CAM software used by some manufacturers.

- **Include netlist attributes:** When enabled, the plotted Gerber files
  will include netlist information that can be used for checking the
  design in CAM software. When X2 format mode is disabled, this
  information is included as comments in the Gerber files.

- **Disable aperture macros:** When enabled, all shapes will be plotted
  as primitives rather than by using aperture macros. This setting
  should only be used for compatibility with old or buggy CAM software
  when requested by your manufacturer.

### PostScript options

- **Scale factor:** Controls how coordinates in the board file will be
  scaled to coordinates in the PostScript file. Using a different value
  for X and Y scale factors will result in a stretched / distorted
  output. These factors may be used to correct for scaling in the
  PostScript output device to achieve an exact-scale output.

- **Track width correction:** A global factor that is added (or
  subtracted, if negative) from the size of tracks, vias, and pads when
  plotting a PostScript file. This factor may be used to correct for
  errors in the PostScript output device to achieve an exact-scale
  output.

- **Force A4 output:** When enabled, the generated PostScript file will
  be A4 size even if the KiCad board file is a different size.

### SVG options

- **Precision:** Controls how many significant digits will be used to
  store coordinates.

- **Output mode:** Controls whether the generated SVG file is in color
  or black and white.

- **Fit page to board:** When enabled, the generated SVG will have the
  same size as the board outline.

### DXF options

- **Plot graphic items using their contours:** Graphic shapes in DXF
  files have no width. This option controls how graphic shapes with a
  width (thickness) in a KiCad board are plotted to a DXF file. When
  this option is enabled, the outer contour of the shape will be
  plotted. When this option is disabled, the centerline of the shape
  will be plotted (and the shape’s thickness will not be visible in the
  resulting DXF file).

- **Use KiCad font to plot text:** When enabled, text in the KiCad
  design will be plotted as graphic shapes using the KiCad font. When
  disabled, text will be plotted as DXF text objects, which will use a
  different font and will not appear in exactly the same position and
  size as shown in the KiCad board editor.

- **Export units:** Controls the units that will be used in the DXF
  file. Since the DXF format has no specified units system, you must
  export using the same units setting that you want to use for importing
  into other software.

### PDF options

- **Output mode:** Controls whether the generated PDF file is in color
  or black and white.

- **Generate property popups for front footprints:** When enabled,
  interactive popups will be added to the generated PDF containing part
  information for each footprint on the front of the board.

- **Generate property popups for back footprints:** When enabled,
  interactive popups will be added to the generated PDF containing part
  information for each footprint on the back of the board. For details,
  see the [Schematic Editor
  documentation](../eeschema/eeschema_generating_outputs.xml#interactive-pdf-features).

- **Generate metadata from AUTHOR and SUBJECT variables:** Sets the
  Author and Subject PDF document properties for the generated PDF based
  on the `AUTHOR` and `SUBJECT` [project text
  variables](#board-setup-text-variables), if you have defined them.

- **Single document:** When enabled, each layers will be plotted as an
  individual sheet within a single PDF document. When disabled, each
  layer will be plotted as a separate PDF file.

- **Background color:** Sets the background color for the PDF plot.
  Background color is not available when the output mode is black and
  white.

## Drill files

KiCad can generate CNC drilling files required by most PCB manufacturing
processes in either Excellon or Gerber X2 format. KiCad can also
generate a drill map: a graphical plot of the board showing drill
locations. To open the dialog, select the **Drill Files (.drl)…​** option
from the **Fabrication Outputs** section of the **File** menu, or click
the **Generate Drill Files…​** button in the Plot dialog.

<figure>
<img src="images/generate_drill_files_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="generate drill files dialog" />
</figure>

- **Output folder:** Choose the folder to save generated drill and map
  files to. If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the
  project directory.

- **Drill file format:** Choose whether to generate Excellon drill files
  (required by most PCB manufacturers) or Gerber X2 files.

- **Mirror Y axis:** For Excellon files, choose whether or not to mirror
  the Y-axis coordinate. This option should in general not be used when
  having PCBs manufactured by a third party, and is provided for
  convenience for users who are making PCBs themselves.

- **Minimal header:** For Excellon files, choose whether to output a
  minimal header rather than a full file header. This option should not
  be enabled unless requested by your manufacturer.

- **PTH and NPTH in single file:** By default, plated holes and
  non-plated holes will be generated in two different Excellon files.
  With this option enabled, both will be merged into a single file. This
  option should not be enabled unless requested by your manufacturer.

- **Use alternate drill mode for oval holes:** Controls how oval holes
  are represented in an Excellon drill file. When not enabled, a route
  command is used to represent oval holes. This is correct for most
  manufacturers. Only choose the **Use alternate drill mode** setting if
  requested by your manufacturer.

- **Generate map:** Choose whether to generate a drill map and, if so,
  in which format. Supported formats are Postscript, Gerber X2, DXF,
  SVG, and PDF.

- **Origin:** Choose the coordinate origin for drill files. **Absolute**
  will use the page origin at the top left corner. **Drill/place file
  origin** will use the origin specified in the board design.

- **Drill units:** Choose the units for drill coordinates and sizes.

- **Zeros:** Controls how zeroes are formatted in an Excellon drill
  file. Select an option here based on your manufacturer’s
  recommendations.

## IPC-2581 files

IPC-2581 files are XML files that contain complete fabrication and
assembly data for a board design. If your manufacturer accepts IPC-2581
files, these can replace Gerber files, drill files, and component
placement files. To create an IPC-2581 file, select **IPC-2581 File
(.xml)…​** from the **Fabrication Outputs** section of the **File** menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/generate_ipc_2581_files_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="generate ipc 2581 files dialog" />
</figure>

IPC-2581 output has the following options:

- **File:** Choose the filename for the generated IPC-2581 file. If a
  relative path is entered, it will be relative to the project
  directory.

- **Units:** Choose the units for the generated file. Can be
  **millimeters** or **inches**.

- **Precision:** Choose the number of digits after the decimal point for
  numbers in the generated file.

- **Version:** Choose the IPC-2581 standard version (B or C).

- **Compress output:** If enabled, the generated file will be compressed
  as a ZIP file.

- **Internal ID:** Choose the footprint field to use for the BOM’s
  internal ID column. This can be a generated unique ID or set to any
  footprint field in the design.

- **Manufacturer P/N:** Choose the footprint field to use for the BOM’s
  manufacturer part number column. This can be omitted or set to any
  footprint field in the design.

- **Manufacturer:** Choose the footprint field to use for the BOM’s
  manufacturer column. This can be omitted or set to any footprint field
  in the design.

- **Distributor P/N:** Choose the footprint field to use for the BOM’s
  distributor part number column. This can be omitted or set to any
  footprint field in the design.

- **Distributor:** Choose the footprint field to use for the BOM’s
  distributor column. This can be omitted or set to any footprint field
  in the design.

## ODB++ files

ODB++ output is a database of files that contains complete fabrication
and assembly data for a board design. If your manufacturer accepts ODB++
files, these can replace Gerber files, drill files, and component
placement files. To create an ODB++ file, select **ODB++ Output File…​**
from the **Fabrication Outputs** section of the **File** menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/odb.png" alt="odb" />
</figure>

ODB++ output has the following options:

- **Output file:** Choose the filename for the generated ODB++ file. If
  a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the project
  directory.

- **Units:** Choose the units for the generated file. Can be
  **millimeters** or **inches**.

- **Precision:** Choose the number of digits after the decimal point for
  numbers in the generated file.

- **Compression format:** Choose the type of compression for the
  generated output. Can be **ZIP**, **TGZ**, or **none**. If none, the
  output will be a folder.

## Component placement files

Component placement files are text files that list each component
(footprint) on the board along with its center position and orientation.
These files are usually used for programming pick-and-place machines,
and may be required by your manufacturer if you are ordering
fully-assembled PCBs. To create placement files, select **Component
Placement (.pos, .gbr)…​** from the **Fabrication Outputs** section of
the **File** menu.

<div class="note">

A footprint will not appear in generated placement files if the "Exclude
from position files" option is enabled for that footprint. This may be
used for excluding certain footprints that do not represent physical
components to be assembled. You can also optionally exclude DNP
components, depending on your manufacturer’s requirements.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/generate_placement_files_dialog.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="generate placement files dialog" />
</figure>

- **Format:** Choose between generating a plain text (ASCII),
  comma-separated text (CSV), or Gerber X3 placement file format.

- **Units:** Choose the units for component locations in the placement
  file.

- **Include only SMD footprints:** When enabled, only footprints with
  the SMD fabrication attribute will be included. Check with your
  manufacturer to determine if non-SMD footprints should be included or
  excluded from the position file.

- **Exclude all footprints with through hole pads:** When enabled,
  footprints will be excluded from the placement file if they contain
  any through-hole pads, even if their fabrication type is set to SMD.

- **Exclude all footprints with the Do Not Populate flag set:** When
  enabled, footprints will be excluded from the placement file if they
  have the Do Not Populate attribute set. Check with your manufacturer
  to determine if DNP components should be included or excluded from the
  position file.

- **Include board edge layer:** For Gerber placement files, controls
  whether or not the board outline is included with the footprint
  placement data.

- **Use drill/place file origin:** When enabled, component positions
  will be relative to the drill/place file origin set in the board
  design. When disabled, the positions will be relative to the page
  origin (upper left corner).

- **Use negative X coordinates for footprints on bottom layer:** When
  enabled, the X coordinates will be flipped (negated) for footprints on
  the bottom layer.

- **Generate single file with both front and back positions:** When
  enabled, positions for front and back footprints will be saved in a
  single file. When disabled, separate files will be generated for front
  and back footprints.

## Additional fabrication outputs

KiCad can also generate footprint report files, IPC-D-356 netlist files,
and a bill of materials (BOM) from the board design. These output
formats have no configurable options.

## Printing

KiCad can print the board view to a standard printer using the Print
action in the File menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/print_dialog.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="print dialog" />
</figure>

- **Include layers:** Select the layers to include in the printout.
  Unselected layers will be invisible. Right-click the list for layer
  selection commands.

- **Output mode:** Choose whether to print in black and white or full
  color.

- **Print drawing sheet:** When enabled, the page border and title block
  will be printed.

- **Print according to objects tab of appearance manager:** When
  enabled, any objects that have been hidden in the Objects tab of the
  Appearance panel will be hidden in the printout. When disabled, these
  objects will be printed if the layer they appear on is selected in the
  Included Layers area.

- **Print background color:** When printing in full color, this option
  controls whether or not the view background color will be printed.

- **Use a different color theme for printing:** When printing in full
  color, this option allows a different color theme to be used for
  printing. When disabled, the color theme used by the board editor will
  be used for printing.

- **Drill marks:** Controls whether to show drilled holes at their
  actual size, at a small size, or hide them from the printout.

- **Print mirrored:** When enabled, the printout will be mirrored
  horizontally.

- **Print one page per layer:** When enabled, each layer selected in the
  Included Layers area will be printed to an individual page. If this
  option is enabled, the **Print board edges on all pages** option
  controls whether to add the Edge.Cuts layer to each printed page.

- **Scale:** controls the scale of the printout relative to the page
  size configured in Page Setup.

## Exporting files

KiCad can export a board design to various third-party formats for use
with external software. These functions are found in the **Export**
section of the **File** menu.

### Specctra DSN exporter

The Specctra DSN exporter creates a file suitable for importing into
certain third-party autorouter software. This exporter has no
configurable options.

### GenCAD exporter

The GenCAD exporter creates a GenCAD file for fabrication, testing, or
importing into other software.

<figure>
<img src="images/gencad_exporter.png" alt="gencad exporter" />
</figure>

The GenCAD exporter has several options.

- **Flip bottom footprint padstacks:** If enabled, separate flipped
  padstack definitions will be added for bottom-side footprints. This
  may be necessary for importing into some third-party software.

- **Generate unique pin names:** If enabled, a suffix will be added to
  each pin name so that no footprint in the generated file will have two
  pins with the same name.

- **Generate a new shape for each footprint instance:** If enabled, a
  unique footprint will be output for every footprint instance, even if
  two footprints are identical.

- **Use drill/place file origin as origin:** If enabled, coordinates in
  the generated file will be relative to the drill/place file origin.

- **Save the origin coordinates in the file:** If enabled, the selected
  origin coordinates will be included in the generated file. If not
  enabled, the origin in the generated file will be set to (0,0).

### VRML exporter

The VRML exporter creates a VRML (`.wrl`) 3D model file containing the
PCB and any VRML files specified in footprints. VRML models are suitable
for use in applications where visual appearance is important and
dimensional accuracy is not critical.

<figure>
<img src="images/vrml_exporter.png" alt="vrml exporter" />
</figure>

The VRML exporter has several options.

- **Coordinate origin options:** Selects the origin for the generated
  model. If **user defined origin** is selected, you can manually
  specify the origin point.

- **Units:** Selects the unit system for the generated model. Dimensions
  in the generated model will be scaled appropriately.

- **Ignore 'Do not populate' components:** If enabled, VRML files for
  footprints with the 'Do not populate' attribute set will not be
  included.

- **Ignore 'Unspecified' components:** If enabled, VRML files for
  footprints with the 'Unspecified' footprint type will not be included.

- **Copy 3D model files to 3D model path:** If enabled, VRML files
  referenced in footprints will be copied into a subdirectory of the
  directory containing the generated board VRML model, and the generated
  model will reference the copied files. The subdirectory name is set by
  the **footprint 3D model path** field. If disabled, VRML files
  referenced in footprints will be embedded in the generated VRML files.

- **Use relative paths to model files in board VRML file:** If enabled,
  references to external models will use paths relative to the generated
  board VRML file. If disabled, the references will use absolute paths.
  This option is only available when the **copy 3D model files to 3D
  model path** option is enabled.

### IDF exporter

The IDF exporter exports an
[IDFv3](http://www.simplifiedsolutionsinc.com/images/idf_v30_spec.pdf)
compliant board (`.emn`) and library (`.emp`) file for communicating
mechanical dimensions to a mechanical CAD package. The exporter exports
the board outline and cutouts, all pad and mounting through holes
including slotted holes, and component outlines; this is the most basic
set of mechanical data required for interaction with mechanical
designers. All other entities described in the IDFv3 specification are
currently not exported.

<div class="note">

You must attach IDF component models to your design’s footprints before
they will be included in the exported model. For more information on
attaching models to footprints, see the [footprint
documentation](#creating-and-editing-footprints). Some IDF-specific
guidance is included in the [Advanced Topics
documentation](#idf-component-outlines).

</div>

<div class="note">

For more information on creating IDF component models, including
descriptions of the IDF utility tools included with KiCad, see the
[Advanced Topics documentation](#idf-component-outlines).

</div>

Once models have been specified for all desired components, the model of
the board can be exported. In the PCB Editor, select **File** →
**Export** → **IDFv3…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/idf_export.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="IDF output settings" />
</figure>

- **Grid reference point:** Choose where the exported model’s reference
  point should be. If the **Adjust automatically** option is selected,
  KiCad will set the reference point to the centroid of the PCB.
  Otherwise, the reference point is set relative to the display origin.

- **Output units:** Choose whether the exported model’s units are
  millimeters or mils.

- **Ignore 'Do not populate' components:** If enabled, IDF files for
  footprints with the 'Do not populate' attribute set will not be
  included.

- **Ignore 'Unspecified' components:** If enabled, IDF files for
  footprints with the 'Unspecified' footprint type will not be included.

The outputs can be viewed directly in a mechanical CAD application or
converted to VRML using the [`idf2vrml` tool](#idf2vrml).

### 3D model exporter (STEP / GLB / BREP / XAO / PLY / STL / STPZ)

The 3D model exporter creates a 3D model file from the PCB and any STEP
files specified in footprints. A number of formats are supported:

- STEP

- GLB (binary glTF)

- BREP (OCCT-native boundary representation)

- XAO (SALOME/Gmsh)

- PLY

- STL

- STPZ (GZIP-compressed STEP)

Different formats may be appropriate for different usecases. For
example, STEP models are suitable for use in mechanical CAD
applications, while XAO models are useful for physical simulations.

<div class="note">

KiCad’s footprint library includes both STEP and VRML (`.wrl`) versions
of each model. However, footprints in KiCad’s library only reference the
VRML versions of the models. VRML models are not included in STEP
exports, but the STEP exporter will instead include the corresponding
STEP version of the model if the **subsitute similarly named models**
option is enabled.

</div>

<div class="note">

KiCad can also export 3D models in [VRML](#vrml-exporter) and
[IDF](#idf-exporter) formats, but these formats use separate exporters.

</div>

To use the 3D model exporter, click **File** → **Export** → **STEP / GLB
/ BREP / XAO / PLY / STL…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/step_exporter.png" alt="step exporter" />
</figure>

Choose a 3D model format from the **Format** dropdown menu and specify
an output filename in the **File** selector.

There are a number of options for configuring the output model.

#### Board options

- **Export board body:** If enabled, the board body (non-copper) will be
  modeled in the exported model.

- **Cut vias in board body:** If enabled, via holes will be cut in the
  board body even if conductor layers are not modeled.

- **Export silkscreen:** If enabled, silkscreen will be modeled in the
  exported model. Silkscreen is modeled as a set of flat faces; it is
  not three-dimensional.

- **Export solder mask:** If enabled, solder mask will be modeled in the
  exported model. Solder mask is modeled as a set of flat faces; it is
  not three-dimensional.

- **Export components:** If enabled, 3D models for components will be
  included in the exported model (but see **Substitute similarly named
  models**, below). If **All components** is selected, models for all
  components in the PCB will be included. If **Only selected** is
  chosen, only models for the footprints currently selected in the board
  will be included. If **Components matching filter** is selected, only
  models for footprints with references matching the filter will be
  included. The filter supports wildcards and commas, so `C1,R*` will
  include `C1` and all resistors.

#### Conductor options

- **Export tracks and vias:** If enabled, tracks and vias on outer
  layers will be modeled in the exported model.

- **Export pads:** If enabled, pads will be modeled in the exported
  model.

- **Export zones:** If enabled, zones on outer layers will be modeled in
  the exported model.

- **Export inner conductor layers:** If enabled, inner conductor layers
  will be modeled in the exported model.

- **Fuse shapes (time consuming):** If enabled, intersecting geometry
  will be fused into a single shape. This may make the exported file
  easier to work with in some tools, but it also significantly increases
  the export time.

- **Fill all vias:** If enabled, via holes will not be cut in conductor
  layers.

- **Net filter (supports wildcards):** If filled, only conductors
  corresponding to nets that match the filter will be modeled. The
  filter supports wildcards, so `/tx_*` will model `/tx_p` and `/tx_n`
  conductors.

#### Coordinates

- **Coordinates:** Selects the origin for the generated model. If **user
  defined origin** is selected, you can manually specify the origin
  point.

#### Other options

- **Ignore 'Do not populate' components:** If enabled, components with
  the DNP attribute set will not be included in the exported model.

- **Ignore 'Unspecified' components:** If enabled, components with the
  Unspecified footprint type will not be included in the exported model.

- **Substitute similarly named models:** VRML models cannot be used in
  STEP, BREP, or XAO exports, but if this option is enabled the exporter
  will look for an identically named STEP model to include in the export
  instead of a footprint’s specified VRML model. Note that footprints in
  KiCad’s footprint library specify VRML models, but suitably named STEP
  models are also included for each VRML model. Therefore this option
  must be enabled in order to export 3D models for footprints from
  KiCad’s library using this dialog.

- **Overwrite old file:** If enabled, the exported model will overwrite
  an existing file with the same name.

- **Don’t write P-curves to STEP file** If enabled, parametric curves
  will be disabled in the exported STEP/STPZ model. This reduces the
  file size, but may reduce compatibility with some software.

- **Board outline chaining tolerance:** Controls the minimum distance
  between two points for the points to be considered coincident. If the
  board outline in the exported model is not contiguous, try increasing
  this tolerance.

### Footprint association (CMP) exporter

CMP files are used to sync footprint assignments and some other
footprint fields between the PCB and the schematic. You can import CMP
files into the schematic using the schematic editor’s **File** →
**Import** → **Footprint Assignments** menu item. This provides a very
limited form of [back
annotation](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#backannotation). It is recommended
to use the Update Schematic from PCB tool instead.

This exporter has no configurable options.

### Hyperlynx exporter

The Hyperlynx exporter creates a file suitable for importing into Mentor
Graphics (Siemens) HyperLynx simulation and analysis software. This
exporter has no configurable options.
