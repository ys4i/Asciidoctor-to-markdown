# Display and selection controls

## Board layers

Layers in the PCB Editor represent physical copper layers on a board, as
well as graphical layers used for defining things such as silkscreen,
solder mask, and the board edge. There is always one layer that is
active in the editor. The active layer is drawn on top of other layers
and will be the layer assigned to newly-created objects. The active
layer is indicated in the layer selector drop-down box in the top
toolbar and is also highlighted in the appearance panel. To change the
active layer, you can left-click a layer name in the appearance panel,
use the drop-down layer selector in the top toolbar, or use a hotkey.
Layers can be hidden to simplify the board view. You can hide a layer
even if it is the active layer.

### Display order for board layers

The display order for board layers is dynamic and depends on which layer
is selected as the active layer. The active layer is always drawn on top
of other layers. In addition, layers that are related to the active
layer are drawn on top of layers that are unrelated. For example, if you
make B.Silkscreen the active layer, then all of the other back layers
(B.Cu, B.Adhesive, B.Paste, B.Mask, B.Fab, and B.Courtyard) will be
drawn on top of the front, user, and inner copper layers, with
B.Silkscreen topmost. If you make Edge.Cuts active, then it will be
drawn on top, and the User.\* layers and Margin will also be be brought
to the front.

<div class="note">

Selected objects are always drawn on top, even if they are not on the
active layer.

</div>

## The appearance panel

The appearance panel provides controls to manage the visibility, color,
and opacity of objects in the PCB Editor’s drawing canvas. It has three
tabs: the Layers tab contains controls for the board layers, the Objects
tab contains controls for different types of graphical objects, and the
Nets tab contains controls for the appearance of the ratsnest and copper
items.

### Layer controls

In the Layers tab of the appearance panel, each board layer is shown
with its color and visibility state. The active layer is shown
highlighted with an arrow indicator to the left of the color swatch.
Left-click on a layer to choose it as the active layer. Left-click on
the corresponding visibility icon to toggle the layer between visible
and hidden. Double-click or middle-click on the color swatch to change
the layer’s color.

<div class="note">

You must first create a custom color theme in Preferences before you can
change layer colors in the appearance panel.

</div>

Below the list of layers is an expandable panel that contains layer
display options. The first setting controls how non-active layers are
displayed: normal, dimmed, or hidden. The layer display mode can be used
to simplify the view and focus on a single layer. Items on inactive
layers cannot be selected when the non-active layer display mode is
"Dim" or "Hide". You can use the hotkey
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+H</span> to cycle through these display
modes quickly.

**Flip board view** will show the board as if you are looking from the
bottom (that is, mirrored around the Y-axis). This option is also
available in the View menu.

<div class="note">

Flipping the board view does not change the visual layer ordering, the
active layer will remain in front followed by the other layers in their
normal order.

</div>

### Object controls

The Objects tab of the appearance panel is similar to the Layers tab.
The main differences are that some objects have no color setting and
that four types of objects (tracks, vias, pads, and zones) have opacity
control sliders. The opacity setting here will be multiplied with any
opacity set in the layer colors. By default, all objects are fully
opaque except for zones, which are set to translucent in order to make
it easier to see objects through filled zone areas.

### Layer presets

Layer presets store which layers and objects are visible and hidden for
easy recall. There are several built-in layer presets and you can save
your own custom presets. Custom presets are stored in the project
settings for a board, as presets may be specific to a certain board
stackup.

To load a preset, choose it from the Presets drop-down menu at the
bottom of the appearance panel or use the quick switcher by holding down
Ctrl and pressing Tab. Once the quick switcher window appears, you can
press Tab and <span class="keycombo">Shift+Tab</span> to cycle through
the available presets. When you let go of the Ctrl key, the highlighted
preset will be loaded.

To save a custom preset, first use the visibility controls to choose
which layers you want visible, then choose **Save preset…​** from the
Presets drop-down menu. Give your preset a name and it will now be
available via the drop-down menu and the quick switcher. To modify a
custom preset, follow the same process and save the modified version
with the same name to overwrite the existing version. To delete a custom
preset, choose the **Delete preset…​** option from the drop-down menu and
select the preset to be deleted from the list.

### Viewports

Viewports store the current view location and zoom level so you can
quickly switch back to it later, or switch between several saved views.

To load a viewport, choose it from the Viewports drop-down menu at the
bottom of the appearance panel or use the quick switcher by holding down
Shift and pressing Tab. Once the quick switcher window appears, you can
press Tab to cycle through the stored viewports. When you let go of the
Shift key, the highlighted viewport will be loaded.

To save a new viewport, scroll and zoom to show the desired area of the
board, then choose **Save viewport…​** from the Viewports drop-down menu.
Give your viewport a name and it will now be available via the drop-down
menu and the quick switcher. To modify an existing viewport, save a new
viewport with the same name to overwrite the existing version. To delete
a viewport, choose the **Delete viewport…​** option from the drop-down
menu and select the preset to be deleted from the list.

### Net and net class controls

The Nets tab of the appearance panel shows a list of all nets and net
classes in the board. Each net has a visibility control that controls
the visibility of that net in the ratsnest. Hiding nets in the ratsnest
does not change the connectivity of the board and will not impact the
design rule checker; it only is intended to make the ratsnest easier to
understand.

Each net and net class can also have a color assigned. By default, this
color applies to the ratsnest lines for the net (or for all the nets in
the net class). Nets have no color by default; this is indicated by a
checkerboard pattern in the color swatch. Double-click or right-click a
net or net class color swatch to set the color. To give a net class the
same color it has in the schematic, right click the net class and select
**Use color from schematic**.

<div class="note">

The Default net class cannot have a color assigned, as nets in this
class will just use the default ratsnest color defined by the color
theme.

</div>

You can also select and highlight nets and net classes via the
appearance panel: right-click on a net or net class to show these
options in a menu.

Below the list of net classes is an expandable panel that contains net
display options. The first option controls how net colors are applied.
When "All" is selected, all copper items (pads, tracks, vias, and zones)
belonging to a net or net class will take on the chosen color. When
"Ratsnest" is selected (the default value), only the ratsnest is
affected by net and net class colors. When "None" is selected, net and
net class colors are ignored.

The second option controls how ratsnest lines are drawn. "All layers"
means that ratsnest lines will be drawn between all unconnected items.
"Visible layers" means that no ratsnest lines will be drawn to items
that are on hidden layers, even when those items are unconnected.

<div class="note">

You can configure the thickness of ratsnest lines in the PCB Editor
Editing Options section of the Preferences dialog, to make the ratsnest
more or less visible.

</div>

## Selection and the selection filter

Selecting items in the editing canvas is done with the left mouse
button. Single-clicking on an object will select it and dragging will
perform a box selection. A box selection from left to right will only
select items that are fully inside the box. A box selection from right
to left will select any items that touch the box. A left-to-right
selection box is drawn in yellow, with a cursor that indicates exclusive
selection, and a right-to-left selection box is drawn in blue with a
cursor that indicates inclusive selection.

The selection action can be modified by holding modifier keys while
clicking or dragging. The following modifier keys apply when clicking to
select single items:

| Modifier Keys (Windows)                  | Modifier Keys (Linux)                    | Modifier Keys (macOS)                   | Selection Effect                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl                                     | Ctrl                                     | Cmd                                     | Toggle selection. Note: Ctrl+click can be remapped to highlight net in **Preferences** → **PCB Editor** → **Editing Options**. |
| Shift                                    | Shift                                    | Shift                                   | Add the item to the existing selection.                                                                                        |
| <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Cmd+Shift</span> | Remove the item from the existing selection.                                                                                   |
| long click                               | long click or Alt                        | long click or Option                    | Clarify selection from a pop-up menu.                                                                                          |

The following modifier keys apply when dragging to perform a box
selection:

| Modifier Keys (Windows)                  | Modifier Keys (Linux)                    | Modifier Keys (macOS)                   | Selection Effect                            |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl                                     | Ctrl                                     | Cmd                                     | Toggle selection.                           |
| Shift                                    | Shift                                    | Shift                                   | Add item(s) to the existing selection.      |
| <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Cmd+Shift</span> | Remove item(s) from the existing selection. |

The selection filter panel in the lower right corner of the PCB Editor
window controls which types of objects can be selected with the mouse.
Turning off selection of unwanted object types makes it easier to select
items in a dense board. The "All items" checkbox is a shortcut to turn
the other items on and off. The "Locked items" checkbox is independent
of the rest, and controls whether or not items that have been locked can
be selected. You can right-click any object type in the selection filter
to quickly change the filter to only allow selecting that type of
object.

</figure>

When a connected copper item is selected, you can expand the selection
to other copper items of the same net using the Expand Selection command
in the right-click context menu or with the hotkey U. The first time you
run this command, the selection will be expanded to the nearest pad. The
second time, the selection will be expanded to all connected items on
all layers.

Selecting an object displays information about the object in the message
panel at the bottom of the window. Double-clicking an object opens a
window to edit the object’s properties.

Pressing Esc will always cancel the current tool or operation and return
to the selection tool. Pressing Esc while the selection tool is active
will clear the current selection.

## Net highlighting

An electrical net (or set of nets) can be highlighted in the PCB editor
to visualize how the net is routed across the PCB. Net highlighting can
be activated by selecting the net to highlight in the PCB editor or by
selecting the corresponding net in the schematic editor when cross-probe
highlighting is enabled (see below). When net highlighting is active,
the highlighted net or nets will be shown in a brighter color and all
other items will be shown in a dimmer color than normal.

There are several ways to select a net or nets to highlight in the PCB
editor:

- Use the hotkey \` after selecting a copper object, or while hovering
  over a copper object

- Right click a copper object in the editing canvas and select **Net
  Inspection Tools** → **Highlight Net**

- Right click a net in the **Nets** tab of the Appearance panel and
  select **Highlight**

- Double click a net in the [Net Inspector](#net-inspector)

When you press the Highlight Net hotkey, the nets of any selected copper
items will be highlighted. If no copper items are selected, the net of
the copper item under the editor cursor will be highlighted.

Net highlighting can be cleared by using the Clear Net Highlight action
(hotkey ~) or by using the Highlight net tool on an empty region in the
board. By default, Esc also clears net highlighting, but this can be
disabled if desired in **Preferences** → **PCB Editor** → **Editing
Options**.

When a net or nets have been selected for highlighting, the Toggle Net
Highlighting action becomes enabled on the left toolbar (also accessible
by hotkey, <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+\`</span>). This action will turn
the highlighting display on or off without choosing a new net to
highlight.

## Cross-probing from the schematic

KiCad allows bi-directional cross-probing between the schematic and the
PCB. There are several different types of cross-probing.

**Selection cross-probing** allows you to select a symbol or pin in the
schematic to select the corresponding footprint or pad in the PCB (if
one exists) and vice-versa. By default, cross-probing will result in the
display centering on the cross-probed item and zooming to fit. You can
disable the centering and zooming behavior, or disable selection
cross-probing entirely, in the Display Options section of the
Preferences dialog. Even when selection cross-probing is disabled, you
can manually cross-probe from the schematic to the PCB by right-clicking
an object and selecting **Select on PCB**, or from the PCB to the
schematic by right-clicking an object and choosing **Select** → **Select
on Schematic**.

**Highlight cross-probing** allows you to highlight a net in the
schematic and PCB at the same time. If the option "Highlight
cross-probed nets" is enabled in the Display Options section of the
Preferences dialog, highlighting a net or bus in the schematic editor
will cause the corresponding net or nets to be highlighted in the PCB
editor.

The left toolbar provides options to change the display of items in the
PCB Editor.
