# Introduction to the KiCad Schematic Editor

The KiCad Schematic Editor is a schematic capture application
distributed as a part of KiCad and available for the following operating
systems:

- Linux

- Apple macOS

- Windows

Regardless of the OS, all KiCad files are 100% compatible from one OS to
another.

The Schematic Editor is an integrated application where all functions of
schematic drawing, PCB footprint selection, library management, and data
transfer to and from the PCB design software are carried out within the
editor itself.

The KiCad Schematic Editor is intended to communicate directly with the
KiCad PCB Editor for designing printed circuit boards without using any
intermediate files. It can also export netlist files, which list all the
electrical connections, for other packages.

The Schematic Editor includes a symbol library editor, which can create
and edit symbols and manage libraries. It also integrates the following
additional but essential functions needed for modern schematic capture
software:

- Electrical rules check (ERC) for automatic detection of incorrect and
  missing connections

- Circuit simulation using ngspice

- Export of plot files in many formats (Postscript, PDF, HPGL, and SVG)

- Bill of Materials generation (via Python or XSLT scripts, which allow
  many flexible formats).

The Schematic Editor supports multi-sheet schematics in several ways:

- Flat hierarchies (schematic sheets are not explicitly connected in a
  master diagram).

- Simple hierarchies (each schematic sheet is used only once).

- Complex hierarchies (some schematic sheets are used multiple times).

Hierarchical schematics are described in detail [later in the
manual](#hierarchical-schematics).

## Initial Configuration

When the Schematic Editor is run for the first time, if the the global
symbol library table file `sym-lib-table` is not found in the KiCad
configuration folder then KiCad will ask how to create this file:

<figure>
<img src="images/en/symbol-lib-table-configuration.png"
style="width:80.0%" alt="symbol library table initial configuration" />
</figure>

The first option is recommended (**Copy default global symbol library
table (recommended)**). The default symbol library table includes all of
the standard symbol libraries that are installed as part of KiCad.

If this option is disabled, KiCad was unable to find the default global
symbol library table. This probably means you did not install the
standard symbol libraries with KiCad, or they are not installed where
KiCad expects to find them. On some systems the KiCad libraries are
installed as a separate package.

- If you have installed the standard KiCad symbol libraries and want to
  use them, but the first option is disabled, select the second option
  and browse to the `sym-lib-table` file in the directory where the
  KiCad libraries were installed.

- If you already have a custom symbol library table that you would like
  to use, select the second option and browse to your `sym-lib-table`
  file.

- If you want to construct a new symbol library table from scratch,
  select the third option.

Symbol library management, including how to re-run this initial
configuration, is described in more detail
[later](#managing-symbol-libraries).

## The Schematic Editor User Interface

<figure>

alt="Schematic Editor overview" />
</figure>

The main Schematic Editor user interface is shown above. The center
contains the main editing canvas, which is surrounded by:

- Top toolbars (file management, zoom tools, editing tools)

- Left toolbar (display options), [Hierarchy
  Navigator](#navigating-between-sheets), [Properties
  Manager](#properties-manager), and the [selection filter](#selection)
  at left

- Message panel and status bar at bottom

- Right toolbar (drawing and design tools) and [Design Block
  panel](#schematic-design-blocks) at right

## Navigating the editing canvas

The editing canvas displays the schematic being designed. You can pan
and zoom to different parts of the schematic and open any schematic
sheet in the design.

By default, dragging with the middle or right mouse button will pan the
canvas view and scrolling the mouse wheel will zoom the view in or out.
You can change this behavior in the Mouse and Touchpad section of the
preferences (see [Configuration and
Customization](#configuration-and-customization) for details).

Several other zoom tools are available in the top toolbar:

- ![Zoom In icon](images/icons/zoom_in_24.png) zooms in on the center of
  the viewport.

- ![Zoom Out icon](images/icons/zoom_out_24.png) zooms out from the
  center of the viewport.

- ![Zoom to Page icon](images/icons/zoom_fit_in_page_24.png) zooms to
  fit the frame around the drawing sheet.

- ![Zoom to Objects icon](images/icons/zoom_fit_to_objects_24.png) zooms
  to fit every item in the schematic (not including the drawing sheet).
  For instance, if there are items placed outside of the drawing sheet,
  they will be visible after zooming to objects.

- ![Zoom to Selection icon](images/icons/zoom_area_24.png) allows you to
  draw a box to determine the zoomed area.

The cursor’s current position is displayed at the bottom of the window
(X and Y), along with the current zoom factor (Z), the cursor’s relative
position (dx, dy, and dist), the grid setting, and the display units.

The relative coordinates can be reset to zero by pressing Space. This is
useful for measuring distance between two points or aligning objects.

## Hotkeys

The <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+F1</span> shortcut displays the current
hotkey list. The default hotkey list is included in the [Actions
Reference](#eeschema-actions-reference) section of the manual.

The hotkeys described in this manual use the key labels that appear on a
standard PC keyboard. On an Apple keyboard layout, use the Cmd key in
place of Ctrl, and the Option key in place of Alt.

Many actions do not have hotkeys assigned by default, but hotkeys can be
assigned or redefined using the hotkey editor (**Preferences** →
**Preferences…​** → **[Hotkeys](#preferences-controls)**).

<div class="note">

Many of the actions available through hotkeys are also available in
context menus. To access the context menu, right-click in the editing
canvas. Different actions will be available depending on what is
selected or what tool is active.

</div>

Hotkeys are stored in the file `user.hotkeys` in KiCad’s configuration
directory. The location is platform-specific:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\kicad\9.0\user.hotkeys`

- Linux: `~/.config/kicad/9.0/user.hotkeys`

- macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/kicad/9.0/user.hotkeys`

KiCad can import hotkey settings from a `user.hotkeys` file using the
**Import Hotkeys** button in the hotkey editor.

## Selection and the selection filter

Selecting items in the editing canvas is done with the left mouse
button. Single-clicking on an object will select it. Clicking and
dragging will perform a box selection. A box selection from left to
right will only select items that are fully inside the box. A box
selection from right to left will select any items that touch the box. A
left-to-right selection box is drawn in yellow, with a cursor that
indicates exclusive selection, and a right-to-left selection box is
drawn in blue with a cursor that indicates inclusive selection.

The selection action can be modified by holding modifier keys while
clicking or dragging. The following modifier keys apply when clicking to
select single items:

| Modifier Keys (Windows)                  | Modifier Keys (Linux)                    | Modifier Keys (macOS)                   | Selection Effect                             |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl                                     | Ctrl                                     | Cmd                                     | Toggle selection.                            |
| Shift                                    | Shift                                    | Shift                                   | Add the item to the existing selection.      |
| <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Cmd+Shift</span> | Remove the item from the existing selection. |
| long click                               | long click or Alt                        | long click or Option                    | Clarify selection from a pop-up menu.        |

The following modifier keys apply when dragging to perform a box
selection:

| Modifier Keys (Windows)                  | Modifier Keys (Linux)                    | Modifier Keys (macOS)                   | Selection Effect                            |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl                                     | Ctrl                                     | Cmd                                     | Toggle selection.                           |
| Shift                                    | Shift                                    | Shift                                   | Add item(s) to the existing selection.      |
| <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Cmd+Shift</span> | Remove item(s) from the existing selection. |

The selection filter panel in the lower left corner of the Schematic
Editor window controls which types of objects can be selected with the
mouse. Turning off selection of unwanted object types makes it easier to
select items in a busy schematic. The "All items" checkbox is a shortcut
to turn the other items on and off. You can right-click any object type
in the selection filter to quickly change the filter to only allow
selecting that type of object.

<figure>
<img src="images/selection_filter.png" alt="selection filter" />
</figure>

Selecting an object displays information about the object in the message
panel at the bottom of the window. Double-clicking an object opens a
window to edit the object’s properties.

Pressing Esc will always cancel the current tool or operation and return
to the selection tool. Pressing Esc while the selection tool is active
will clear the current selection.
