# Welcome

KiCad is a free and open-source electronics design automation (EDA)
suite. It features schematic capture, integrated circuit simulation,
printed circuit board (PCB) layout, 3D rendering, and plotting/data
export to numerous formats. KiCad also includes a high-quality component
library featuring thousands of symbols, footprints, and 3D models. KiCad
has minimal system requirements and runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

KiCad 9.0 is the most recent major release. It includes hundreds of new
features and bug fixes. Some of the most notable new features include:

- You can now define output jobsets, which can generate multiple output
  files from your schematic and PCB design files at the click of a
  button. Jobsets can be used to generate fabrication outputs, run ERC
  and DRC, and perform other automated tasks. You can also reuse jobset
  definitions between projects.

- The interactive router has been improved in many ways, including
  adding the ability to drag multiple traces. Performance has also been
  improved.

- Nets can now have multiple net classes assigned, with cascading
  properties based on net class priority.

- Symbols can be assigned to component classes, which conceptually group
  related components together. Component classes can be used in the PCB
  editor for applying DRC rules to related components, or as part of
  multichannel (repeated) layouts.

- Padstacks have been added, allowing independent control over pad/via
  sizes and shapes for each board layer. Via tenting can also be
  controlled per-via and per-side.

- The PCB Editor now supports multichannel layouts, where the layout for
  one section of a board can be repeated multiple times and applied to
  other parts of the design that should be laid out in the same way.

- The selection filter is now available in the Schematic and Symbol
  Editors. This complements the selection filter in the PCB and
  Footprint Editors, which were added in version 6.0.

- External files, such as datasheets, drawing sheets, 3D models, and
  fonts, can be embedded in a schematic or board file for greater
  portability.

- New design rule checks have been added for creepage, differential pair
  skew, and acute angles between tracks. Clearance and Creepage checks
  now display the minimum clearance/creepage path visually.

- Board designs can be exported in the ODB++ format, which includes
  complete fabrication and assembly information in a single archive.

- The 3D model exporter has been improved to support more formats. It
  also supports modelling more copper details from the board and
  provides more options to control which data is included.

- The KiCad Project Manager now supports git operations for projects
  that are version controlled using git.

- The Schematic and PCB Editors can now draw and edit tables for
  displaying tabular data.

- A bezier curve tool has been added in all editors.

- New positioning shape modification tools have been added in the PCB
  and Footprint Editors, including an interactive positioning tool, an
  outset shape tool, and a dogbone corner tool.

- Improved snapping features have been added while editing shapes in the
  PCB and Footprint Editors. You can snap to endpoints, intersections,
  and projections from other snapping points. Graphical indicators are
  shown that describe the active snapping point.

- A new IPC API has been developed for creating PCB Editor plugins and
  scripts. In version 9, this is only available in the PCB Editor. In
  future versions of KiCad, this will also be available in the Schematic
  Editor. The legacy SWIG-based plugin system still exists, but will be
  removed in a future version of KiCad.

- Significant improvements have been made to the Symbol, Footprint, and
  3D Model libraries.

# Installing and Upgrading KiCad

KiCad maintains compatibility and support with the maintained versions
of Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and a number of Linux distributions.
Some platforms have specific installation or upgrade instructions.
Always check <https://www.kicad.org/download/> for the latest release
information and instructions for your platform.

KiCad may compile and run on platforms that are not officially
supported. The KiCad development team makes no guarantees that KiCad
will continue to work on these platforms in the future. See
<https://www.kicad.org/help/system-requirements/> for more details on
supported platforms and hardware requirements.

KiCad uses a "major.minor.point" release version format. Major releases
bring new features and other significant changes to the code. Minor
releases are relatively rare and typically bring bug fixes that are too
complicated for a point release. Point releases contain only bugfixes.
Users are encouraged to update to the latest point release for their
current major.minor version promptly, as these releases will not break
file compatibility. Major releases almost always come with changes to
file formats. KiCad is in general always backwards compatible with files
created by older versions, but not forwards compatible: Once files are
edited and saved by a new major version, these files will not be
openable by the previous major version.

## Migrating from Previous Versions

In general, to migrate a design to a new version of KiCad, simply open
the project with the new version, then open the schematic and PCB and
save each file. More details about specific issues that may come up when
migrating designs is covered in the Schematic Editor and PCB Editor
chapters of the manual.

<div class="note">

Make sure to save a backup of your design before opening it with a new
version of KiCad. Once saved in a new major version of KiCad, designs
can no longer be opened by previous major versions.

</div>

The symbol library format changed in KiCad 6.0. To continue editing
symbol libraries made with a previous version of KiCad, these libraries
need to be migrated to the new format. For details on this process, see
the Schematic Editor chapter of the manual. Symbol libraries that have
not been migrated can still be opened and used in read-only mode.

# KiCad Workflow

This section presents a high-level overview of the typical KiCad
workflow. Note that KiCad is a flexible software system, and there are
other ways of working that are not described here. For more information
about each of the steps described in this section, please see the later
chapters in this manual.

<div class="note">

A number of tutorials and guided lessons in using KiCad have been
created by community members. These resources can be a good way to learn
KiCad for some new users. See the Further Reading section at the end of
this chapter for more information.

## Basic Terminology

KiCad uses a number of terms that are fairly standard in the area of
electronics design automation (EDA) software, and some that are more
specific to KiCad. This section lists some of the most common terms used
throughout KiCad’s documentation and user interface. Other terms that
are more specific to a certain part of the KiCad workflow are defined
later in this manual.

A **schematic** is a collection of one or more pages (sheets) of circuit
schematic drawings. Each KiCad schematic file represents a single sheet.

A **hierarchical schematic** is a schematic consisting of multiple pages
nested inside each other. KiCad supports hierarchical schematics, but
there must be a single **root sheet** at the top of the hierarchy.
Sheets within a hierarchy (other than the root sheet) may be used more
than once, for example to create repeated copies of a subcircuit.

A **symbol** is a circuit element that can be placed on a schematic.
Symbols can represent physical electrical components, such as a resistor
or microcontroller, or non-physical concepts such as a power or ground
rail. Symbols have **pins** which serve as the connection points that
can be wired to each other in a schematic. For physical components, each
pin corresponds to a distinct physical connection on the component (for
example, a resistor symbol will have two pins, one for each terminal of
the resistor). Symbols are stored in **symbol libraries** so they can be
used in many schematics.

A **netlist** is a representation of a schematic that is used to convey
information to another program. There are many netlist formats used by
various EDA programs, and KiCad has its own netlist format that is used
internally to pass information back and forth between the schematic and
PCB editors. The netlist contains (among other things) all the
information about which pins connect to each other, and what name should
be given to each **net**, or set of connected pins. Netlists can be
written to a **netlist file**, but in modern versions of KiCad, this is
not necessary as part of the normal workflow.

A **printed circuit board**, or PCB, is a design document that
represents the physical implementation of a schematic (or technically, a
netlist). Each KiCad board file refers to a single PCB design. There is
no official support for creating arrays or panels of PCBs within KiCad,
although some community-created add-ons provide this functionality.

A **footprint** is a circuit element that can be placed on a PCB.
Footprints often represent physical electrical components, but can also
be used as a library of design elements (silkscreen logos, copper
antennas and coils, etc.). Footprints can have **pads** which represent
copper areas that are electrically-connected. The netlist will associate
symbol pins with footprint pads.

A **worksheet** is a drawing template, typically containing a title
block and frame, that is used as the template for schematic sheets and
PCB drawings.

**Plotting** is the process of creating manufacturing outputs from a
design. These outputs may include machine-readable formats such as
Gerber files or pick-and-place listings, as well as human-readable
formats such as PDF drawings.

**Ngspice** is a mixed-signal circuit simulator, originally based on
Berkeley SPICE, that is integrated into KiCad’s schematic editor. By
using symbols with attached SPICE models, you can run circuit
simulations on KiCad schematics and plot the results graphically.

## KiCad Components

KiCad consists of a number of different software components, some of
which are integrated together to facilitate the PCB design workflow, and
some of which are standalone. In early versions of KiCad, there was very
little integration between the software components. For example, the
schematic editor (historically called Eeschema) and PCB editor
(historically called PcbNew) were separate applications that had no
direct link, and to create a PCB based on a schematic, users had to
generate a netlist file in Eeschema and then read this netlist file in
PcbNew. In modern versions of KiCad, the schematic and PCB editor are
integrated into the KiCad project manager, and using netlist files is no
longer required. Many tutorials still exist that refer to the old KiCad
workflow of separate applications and netlist files, so be sure to check
the version being used when looking at tutorials and other
documentation.

The main KiCad components are usually started from the launcher buttons
in the KiCad project manager window. These components include:

| Component name     | Description                                                                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Schematic Editor   | Create and edit schematics; simulate circuits with SPICE; generate BOM files    |
| Symbol Editor      | Create and edit schematic symbols and manage symbol libraries                   |
| PCB Editor         | Create and edit PCBs; export 2D and 3D files; generate fabrication output files |
| Footprint Editor   | Create and edit PCB component footprints and manage footprint libraries         |
| GerbView           | Gerber and drill file viewer                                                    |
| Bitmap2Component   | Convert bitmap images to symbols or footprints                                  |
| PCB Calculator     | Calculator for components, track width, electrical spacing, color codes, etc.   |
| Page Layout Editor | Create and edit worksheet files                                                 |

## User Interface

KiCad has a number of user interface behaviors that are common to all
the different editor windows. Some of these behaviors are described in
more detail in later chapters of this manual.

Objects can be selected by clicking on them or by dragging a selection
window around them. Dragging from left to right will result in a
selection of any items that are completely within the window. Dragging
from right to left will result in a selection of any items that touch
the window. Pressing certain modifier keys while clicking or dragging
will change the selection behavior. These keys are platform-specific and
are described in the Editing Options section of the Preferences dialog.

KiCad editors have the concept of a **tool** which can be thought of as
a mode that the editor is in. The default tool is the selection tool,
which means that clicking will select objects under the mouse cursor.
There are also tools for placing new objects, inspecting existing
objects, etc. The active tool is highlighted in the toolbar, and the
name of the active tool is shown in the bottom right of the editor in
the status bar. Pressing Esc always means "cancel" in KiCad: if a tool
is in the middle of some action (for example, routing tracks), the first
press of Esc will cancel that action. The next press of Esc will exit
the tool complely, returning to the default selection tool. With the
selection tool active, pressing Esc will clear the current selection, if
one exists.
