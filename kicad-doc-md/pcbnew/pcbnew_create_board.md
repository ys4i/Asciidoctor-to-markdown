# Creating a PCB

## Basic PCB concepts

A printed circuit board in KiCad is generally made up of **footprints**
representing electronic components and their pads, **nets** defining how
those pads connect to each other, **tracks**, **vias**, and **filled
zones** that form the copper connections between pads in each net, and
various graphic shapes defining the board edge, silkscreen markings, and
any other desired information.

KiCad normally keeps the information about nets on a PCB synchronized
with an associated schematic, but nets can also be created and edited
directly within the PCB editor.

## Capabilities

KiCad is capable of creating printed circuit boards with up to 32 copper
layers, 14 technical layers (silkscreen, solder mask, component
adhesive, solder paste, etc), and 13 general-purpose drawing layers.

The internal measurement resolution of all objects in KiCad is 1
nanometer, and measurements are stored as 32-bit integers. This means it
is possible to create boards up to approximately 4 meters by 4 meters.

KiCad currently supports one board file per project / schematic.

## Starting from a schematic

Creating a board from a schematic is the recommended workflow for KiCad.
When you create a new project, KiCad will generate an empty board file
with the same name as the project. To start designing the board after
you have created a schematic, simply open the board file. You can do
this either from the KiCad project manager, or by clicking the "Open PCB
in board editor" button in the schematic editor. To import the schematic
design information into the board editor, including footprints and net
connections, use the **Tools** → **Update PCB from Schematic…​** action
(F8). You can also use the ![Update pcb from schematic
icon](images/icons/update_pcb_from_sch_24.png) icon in the top toolbar.

<div class="note">

Update PCB from Schematic is the preferred way to transfer design
information from the schematic to the PCB. In older versions of KiCad,
the equivalent process was to export a netlist from the Schematic Editor
and import it into the Board Editor. It is no longer necessary to use a
netlist file.

</div>

<figure>

alt="Update PCB from schematic" />
</figure>

For more information about the Update Schematic from PCB tool, see the
[forward annotation section of the
manual](#forward-and-back-annotation).

## Starting from scratch

It is also possible to create a board with no matching schematic,
although this workflow has some limitations and is not recommended for
most users. To do this, you must start the PCB editor standalone (not
from the KiCad project manager). Before beginning your design, it is a
good idea to save the board file, which will also create a project file
to store board settings. Use "Save As…​" from the File menu to choose
where to save your board file. A project file with the same name will be
created in the same location you choose to save the board file in.

## Board setup

Before beginning your board design, use the Board Setup dialog to
configure the basic parameters of the board. To open Board Setup, click
the ![options board](images/icons/options_board.png) icon in the top
toolbar or choose "Board Setup…​" from the File menu.

### Configuring board stackup and physical parameters

There are two sections of Board Setup used to configure the stackup and
layers of the board. The Board Editor Layers section is used to enable
or disable technical (non-copper) layers, and give custom names to
layers if desired. The Physical Stackup section is used to configure the
number of copper layers, as well as the physical parameters of the
copper and dielectric layers such as thickness and material type.
Dielectric, soldermask, and silkscreen layers can have colors assigned
to them, which affects the board’s appearance in the 3D viewer.

To configure the board stackup, start on the Physical Stackup section:

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_physical_stackup.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup physical stackup" />
</figure>

Set the number of copper layers in the upper left corner and then enter
the physical parameters of the stackup if desired. These parameters may
be left at their default values, but note that the board thickness value
will be used when exporting a 3D model of the board, and layer
thicknesses will be included in net length calculations for any nets
that include vias. If you plan to use these features, it is a good idea
to ensure that the stackup thickness is correct.

<div class="note">

KiCad currently only supports stackups with an even number of copper
layers. To create designs with an odd number of layers (for example,
flexible printed circuits or metal-core printed circuits), simply choose
the next highest even number and ignore the extra layer.

</div>

Next, if desired, use the Board Editor Layers section to rename layers
or hide non-copper layers that you will not be using in the design. For
example, if you will not use a back silkscreen on the design, uncheck
the box next to the `B.Silkscreen` layer. Some layers, like `F.Cu` /
`B.Cu` or `Edge.Cuts`, are required layers and therefore cannot be
disabled.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_board_editor_layers.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="board setup board editor layers" />
</figure>

<div class="note">

Copper layers can be designated as signal, power plane, mixed, or jumper
in the Board Editor Layers section. This designation is intended as a
guide for the user only. Tracks and zones can be routed on any copper
layer, no matter what the type is configured to in this dialog.

</div>

You can add additional user-defined layers (`User.1`, `User.2`, etc.) by
clicking the **Add User Defined Layer…​** button in the top right.
User-defined layers can’t be used for routing, but they can contain
arbitrary graphics or other information. By default, user layers are
**auxiliary** layers, meaning that whatever information they contain
does not correspond to either the front or back of the board. User
layers can instead be set to **Off-board, front** or **Off-board,
back**, in which case they correspond to the selected side of the board.
Items on such layers can be flipped from front to back in the same way
as objects on physical front/back layers. Adjacent front/back layers are
treated as paired: if `User.2` is defined as a front layer and `User.3`
is defined as a back layer, flipping an object on `User.2` will move it
to `User.3`, and vice versa.

Some additional board stackup settings are found on the Board Finish and
Solder Mask/Paste sections of the Board Setup dialog. The Board Finish
section has settings for defining the copper finish and special features
such as castellations or edge plating. Note that these settings only
impact the board attributes output as part of Gerber job files at this
time.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_board_finish.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup board finish" />
</figure>

The Solder Mask/Paste section allow global adjustment of the clearance
(positive or negative) between the copper shapes and solder mask /
solder paste shapes of pads on the board. These values will be added to
any clearance overrides set on individual footprints or pads. Positive
clearance values will result in the shape of the solder mask or paste
opening being *larger* than the copper shape. Negative clearance values
will result in the opening being *smaller* than the copper shape.

<div class="warning">

Most commercial PCB fabricators expect these values to be zero and make
their own adjustments to solder mask and paste openings as part of their
CAM process. It is usually best to leave these values at their default
of zero unless you are making the PCB yourself or have specific advice
from your fabricator to use different values.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_solder_mask_paste.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup solder mask paste" />
</figure>

### Configuring default text and graphic settings

The Text & Graphics Defaults section of the Board Setup dialog can be
used to configure the properties that will be used for new text and
graphic shapes that are placed on the board.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_text_and_graphics.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup text and graphics" />
</figure>

Line thickness, text size, and text appearance can be configured for the
six different categories of layers shown in the dialog. Additionally,
the properties for dimension objects can be configured for all layers.
For more details about dimension properties, see the Dimensions section
below.

Dashed line appearance is controlled in the Formatting section. **Dash
length** controls the length of dashes, while **Gap length** controls
the spacing between dashes and dots. The dash and gap lengths are
relative to the line width: a gap length of `2` means twice the width of
the line.

Text replacement variables can be created in the Text Variables section.
These variables allow you to substitute the variable name for any text
string. This substitution happens anywhere the variable name is used
inside the variable replacement syntax of `${VARIABLENAME}`.

For example, you could create a variable named `VERSION` and set the
text substitution to `1.0`. Now, in any text object on the PCB, you can
enter `${VERSION}` and KiCad will substitute `1.0`. If you change the
substitution to `2.0`, every text object that includes `${VERSION}` will
be updated automatically. You can also mix regular text and variables.
For example, you can create a text object with the text
`Version: ${VERSION}` which will be substituted as `Version: 1.0`.

Text variables can also be created in [Schematic
Setup](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#schematic-setup). Text variables are
project-wide; variables created in the schematic editor are also
available in the board editor, and vice versa.

There are also a number of [built-in system text
variables](#text-variables).

### Configuring design rules

Design rules control the behavior of the interactive router, the filling
of copper zones, and the [design rule checker](#design-rule-checking).
Design rules can be modified at any time, but we recommend that you
establish all known design rules at the beginning of the board design
process.

#### Constraints

Basic design rules are configured in the Constraints section of the
Board Setup dialog. Constraints in this section apply to the entire
board and should be set to the values recommended by your board
manufacturer. Any minimum value set here is an *absolute* minimum and
cannot be overridden with a more specific design rule. For example, if
you need the copper clearance on part of a board to be 0.2mm and in the
rest 0.3mm, you must enter 0.2mm for the minimum copper clearance in the
Constraints section and use a net class or custom rule to set the larger
0.3mm clearance.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_constraints.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup constraints" />
</figure>

In addition to setting minimum clearances, a number of features can be
configured here:

| Setting                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Arc/circle approximated by segments                 | In some situations, KiCad must use a series of straight line segments to approximate round shapes such as those of arcs and circles. This setting controls the maximum error allowed by this approximation: in other words, the maximum distance between a point on one of these line segments and the true shape of the arc or circle. Setting this to a lower number than the default value of 0.005mm will result in smoother shapes, but can be very slow on larger boards. The default value typically results in arc approximation error that is not detectable in the manufactured board due to manufacturing tolerances. |
| Allow fillets outside zone outline                  | Zones can have fillets (rounded corners) added in the Zone Properties dialog. By default, no zone copper, including fillets, is allowed outside the zone outline. This effectively means that inside corners of the zone outline will not be filleted even when a fillet is configured. By enabling this setting, inside corners of the zone outline will be filleted even though this results in copper from the zone extending outside the zone outline.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Minimum thermal relief spoke count                  | This sets the minimum acceptable number of thermal relief spokes connecting a pad to a zone. A DRC violation will be generated if this constraint is violated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Include stackup height in track length calculations | By default, the length tuner uses the height of the stackup to calculate the additional length of a track that travels through vias from one layer to another. This calculation relies on the board stackup height being correctly configured. In some situations, it is preferable to ignore the height of vias and just calculate the track length assuming that vias add no length. Disabling this setting will exclude via length from length tuner track length calculations.                                                                                                                                               |

#### Pre-defined Sizes

The pre-defined sizes section allows you to define the track and via
dimensions you want to have available while routing tracks. Net classes
can be used to define the default dimensions for tracks and vias in
different nets (see below) but defining a list of sizes in this section
will allow you to step through these sizes while routing. For example,
you may want the default track width on a board to be 0.2 mm, but use
0.3 mm for some sections that carry more current, and 0.15 mm for some
sections where space is limited. You can define each of these track
widths in the Board Setup dialog and then switch between them when
routing tracks.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_predefined_sizes.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup predefined sizes" />
</figure>

#### Teardrops

The teardrops section lets you set default parameters for various types
of teardrops. There are different settings for teardrop connections to
round objects, rectangular objects, and teardrop connections between
tracks. The default teardrop parameters can be overridden when teardrops
are added, and also changed in the properties for individual connected
items. See the [teardrops documentation](#editing-teardrops) for more
information about each setting.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_teardrops.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup teardrops" />
</figure>

#### Length-tuning patterns

The length-tuning patterns section lets you set default parameters for
each type of length-tuning pattern (single-track length,
differential-pair length, and differential-pair skew). These defaults
can be overridden in the properties of each tuning pattern added to the
board. See the [length tuning documentation](#length-tuning) for more
information.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_length_tuning_patterns.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="board setup length tuning patterns" />
</figure>

#### Net Classes

The Net Classes section allows you to configure routing and clearance
rules for different classes of nets.

More than one net class can be assigned to a net. For nets with multiple
net classes assigned, an effective aggregate net class is formed, taking
any net class properties from the highest priority net class which has
that property set. Net class priority is determined by the ordering in
the Schematic or Board Setup dialogs. The `Default` net class is used as
a fallback for any missing properties after all explicit net classes
have been considered; this means that nets may be part of the `Default`
net class even if they have other net classes explicitly assigned.

[Net classes may be created and
edited](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#schematic-setup-netclasses) in either
the Schematic or Board Setup dialogs.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_netclasses.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup netclasses" />
</figure>

The upper portion of the Net Classes section contains a table showing
the net classes in the design and the design rules that apply to each
net class. Every class has values for copper clearance, track width, via
sizes, and differential pair sizes. These values will be used when
creating tracks and vias unless a more specific rule overrides them (see
Custom Rules below).

<div class="note">

No rule may override the minimum values set in the Constraints section
of Board Setup. For example, if you set a net class clearance to
`0.1 mm`, but the Minimum Clearance in the Constraints section is set to
`0.2 mm`, nets in that class will have a clearance of `0.2 mm`.

</div>

The track widths and via sizes defined for each net class are used when
the track width and via size controls are set to "use netclass values"
in the PCB editor. These widths and sizes are considered the default, or
optimal, sizes for that net class. They are not minimum or maximum
values. Manually changing the track width or via size to a different
value from that defined in the Net Classes section will not result in a
DRC violation. To restrict track width or via size to specific values,
use [Custom Rules](#custom-design-rules).

Each net class can also have a color assigned to it. Depending on how
net colors are configured in the [appearance panel](#appearance-panel),
net class colors can override the default color for ratsnest lines or
copper objects. In addition to arbitrary colors for each net class, you
can set all net classes to use the same color as configured for them in
the schematic editor by clicking the **Import colors from schematic**
button. To use a layer’s default color instead of overriding it with a
custom net class color, set the net class color to transparent.

The lower portion of the Net Classes section lists pattern-based net
class assignments. Working with pattern-based net class assignments is
explained in the [Schematic Editor
documentation](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#schematic-setup-netclasses);
pattern-based assignments can be edited in either the Board or Schematic
Setup windows.

Note that pattern-based assignments can be created directly from the PCB
editing canvas by right clicking a copper track or zone and clicking
**Assign netclass…​**. Net classes can also be assigned in the schematic
using [net class directives or
labels](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#netclass-directive ) instead of
pattern-based assignments.

#### Custom Rules

The Custom Rules section contains a text editor for creating design
rules using the custom rules language. Custom rules are used to create
specific design rule checks that are not covered by the basic
constraints or net class settings.

Custom rules will only be applied if there are no errors in the custom
rules definitions. Use the Check Rule Syntax button to test the
definitions and fix any problems before closing Board Setup.

See [Custom Design Rules](#custom-design-rules) in the Advanced Topics
chapter for more information on the custom rules language as well as
example rules.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_custom_rules.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup custom rules" />
</figure>

#### Violation Severity

The Violation Severity section allows you to configure the severity of
each type of design rule check. Each rule may be set to create an error
marker, a warning marker, or no marker (ignored).

<div class="note">

Individual rule violations may be ignored in the Design Rule Checker.
Setting a rule to Ignore in the Violation Severity section will
completely disable the corresponding design rule check. Use this setting
with caution.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_violation_severity.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup violation severity" />
</figure>

For descriptions of each violation type, and how to ignore individual
violations without disabling all violations of that type, see the [DRC
documentation](#design-rule-checking).

### Embedding files

External files can be embedded within a board file. Embedding a file
stores a copy of the file inside the board file. The design can then
refer to the embedded copy of the file instead of the external file,
which makes the project more portable as it doesn’t rely on an external
file. Fonts, datasheets, drawing sheets, SPICE models, and footprint 3D
models can be embedded and used within KiCad. Other arbitrary files can
also be embedded to store them in the project for later export, but they
are not used by any KiCad functionality. Files embedded in a board
necessarily increase the board’s file size, although files are
compressed before being embedded to minimize the space required.

<figure>
<img src="images/embedded_files.png" alt="embedded files" />
</figure>

Embedded files are managed in the Embedded Files section of Board Setup.
All files embedded in a board are shown here. To embed a file inside a
board, click the ![small folder 16](images/icons/small_folder_16.png)
button and select the file. The file is then embedded inside the PCB and
is listed in the embedded files list along with its *embedded
reference*. The embedded reference is a unique identifier for the
embedded file that begins with `kicad-embed://`. You can use the
embedded reference elsewhere in the Board Editor to refer to the
embedded file as if it were an external file path. You can copy the
embedded reference by right clicking and selecting **Copy Embedded
Reference**. To remove an embedded file, click the ![small trash
16](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button. Any remaining links to the
removed file will become invalid.

<div class="note">

3D models and drawing sheets can be embedded directly using the file
browser when you add them to a footprint ([3D
models](#editing-symbol-properties)) or to a board ([drawing
sheets](#sheet-title-block)) by enabling the **Embed Files** option in
the file browser. This is a single-step shortcut for adding the files in
Board Setup and then referring to them by their embedded reference; the
result is the same.

</div>

To embed any fonts used in a board, check the **Embed fonts** checkbox.
All fonts used in the board design will be embedded, so text using that
font can be edited on any computer regardless of whether the font file
is installed.

You can also [embed files in a footprint](#fp-embedding-files), either
in the board copy of a footprint or in a library. Such files will be
available within the footprint instance but not within the larger board
design or within other footprints. Files embedded in a footprint are
deduplicated when the footprint is added to a board: if a file is
embedded in a footprint, and multiple instances of that footprint are
added to the board, only one copy of the file will be embedded, and all
of the footprint instances will refer to the same embedded file.

As an example, to embed a 3D model in a project and use it within
several footprints, you could embed the model using the Board Setup
dialog, copy the internal reference, and paste the internal reference as
a 3D model path in each footprint that uses that model. Alternatively,
you could embed the model within a single footprint, either in the board
or in the source footprint library. In this case, the footprint itself
is portable if you export the footprints from the board, and the model
embedding is managed in the footprint’s properties rather than Board
Setup. A more convenient way to achieve the same thing, however, is to
open the footprint’s properties dialog, add a 3D model file, and enable
the **Embed File** option in the file browser. Again, this could be done
for a footprint in the board or for a footprint in the source footprint
library.

Files can also be embedded in
[schematics](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#sch-embedding-files).

### Importing settings

You can import part or all of the board setup from an existing board.
This technique can be used to create a "template" board that has the
settings you want to use on multiple designs, and then importing these
settings from the template board into each new board rather than
entering them manually.

<figure>
<img src="images/board_setup_import_settings.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="board setup import settings" />
</figure>

To import settings, click the **Import Settings from Another Board…​**
button at the bottom of the Board Setup dialog and then choose the
`kicad_pcb` file you want to import from. Select which settings you want
to import and the current settings will be overwritten with the values
from the chosen board.

The settings that are available to import are:

- Board layers and physical stackup

- Solder mask/paste defaults

- Text and graphics default properties

- Text & graphics formatting

- Design rule constraints

- Predefined track & via dimensions

- Teardrop defaults

- Length-tuning pattern defaults

- Net classes

- Custom rules

- Violation severities
