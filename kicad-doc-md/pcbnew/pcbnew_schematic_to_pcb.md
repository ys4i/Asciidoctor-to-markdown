# Forward and back annotation

Forward and back annotation are the processes for syncing schematic
changes to the board and syncing board changes to the schematic,
respectively.

## Update PCB From Schematic (forward annotation)

Use the Update PCB from Schematic tool to sync design information from
the Schematic Editor to the Board Editor. The tool can be accessed with
**Tools** → **Update PCB from Schematic** (F8) in both the schematic and
board editors. You can also use the ![Update PCB from Schematic
icon](images/icons/update_pcb_from_sch_24.png) icon in the top toolbar
of the Board Editor. This process is often called forward annotation.

<div class="note">

Update PCB from Schematic is the preferred way to transfer design
information from the schematic to the PCB. In older versions of KiCad,
the equivalent process was to export a netlist from the Schematic Editor
and import it into the Board Editor. It is no longer necessary to use a
netlist file.

</div>

</figure>

The tool adds the footprint for each symbol to the board and transfers
updated schematic information to the board. In particular, the board’s
net connections are updated to match the schematic.

The changes that will be made to the PCB are listed in the *Changes To
Be Applied* pane. The PCB is not modified until you click the **Update
PCB** button.

You can show or hide different types of messages using the checkboxes at
the bottom of the window. A report of the changes can be saved to a file
using the **Save…​** button.

### Options

The tool has several options to control its behavior.

### Re-linking symbols and footprints

Symbols and footprints are linked together using unique identifiers
(also called UUIDs). These are handled automatically within KiCad and
are not usually visible to users. They allow a symbol and its partner
footprint to keep their connection between schematic and PCB, even if
the reference designator is changed. New objects get assigned their
identifiers upon creation.

#### Re-linking by unique identifier (default)

In normal use, the **Re-link footprints to schematic symbols based on
their reference designators** option should be unchecked. In this mode,
symbols with the same identifier as a footprint will update that
footprint, regardless of the reference designator. Symbols which have an
identifier that doesn’t match any footprint will add a new footprint
linked to that identifier.

For example, in the below schematic, both `R1` and `R2` are linked via
their unique IDs to footprints on the PCB:

<figure>
<img src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_ID_link_before_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by unique identifier, before a change in reference designator" />
</figure>

If symbol reference designators are changed in the schematic (e.g. by
re-annotation), running the **Update PCB from Schematic** process will
update the reference designators on the PCB.

<figure>
<img src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_ID_link_after_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by unique identifier, after a change in reference designator" />
</figure>

#### Re-linking by reference designator

If the checkbox is checked, the linking process is done using the
reference designators. This can be useful for workflows that result in a
symbol being deleted and replaced by another one, rather than being
updated in-place. For example, cut-and-pasting a block of schematic or a
sheet and copy-pasting and re-annotating will usually break the
identifier-based links.

For example in the below case, the resistors `R1` and `R2` have been
deleted and replaced, then re-annotated. While the reference designators
are the same, the internal identifiers have changed. Updating the PCB by
identifier would cause the existing footprints to be deleted and new
ones added - to KiCad, the existing footprints have no matching symbol.
This would cause the footprints to lose their positions and need placing
again.

src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_RefDes_link_before_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by reference designator, after deleting and replacing symbols, but before updating the PCB" />
</figure>

Re-linking the footprints by reference designator causes KiCad to
re-create the links, using the matching reference designators as a
guide.

<img
src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_RefDes_link_after_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by reference designator, after updating the PCB" />
</figure>

Because the links have been re-established, the next forward annotation
should use the normal identifier-based linking (i.e. the checkbox should
be unchecked).

## Update Schematic from PCB (back annotation)

The typical workflow in KiCad is to make changes in the schematic and
then sync the changes to the board using the Update PCB From Schematic
tool. However, the reverse process is also possible: design changes can
be made in the board and then synced back to the schematic using
**Tools** → **Update Schematic From PCB** in either the schematic or
board editors. This process is often called back annotation.

<figure>
<img src="images/update_schematic_from_pcb.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Update schematic from PCB" />
</figure>

The tool syncs changes in reference designators, values, footprint
assignments, and net names from the board to the schematic. Each type of
change can be individually enabled or disabled.

The changes that will be made to the schematic are listed in the
*Changes To Be Applied* pane. The schematic is not modified until you
click the **Update Schematic** button.

You can show or hide different types of messages using the checkboxes at
the bottom of the window. A report of the changes can be saved to a file
using the **Save…​** button.

<div class="note">

The [Geographical Reannotation](#geographical-re-annotation) feature can
be used in combination with backannotating reference designators to
reannotate all components in the design based on their location in the
layout.

</div>

### Back annotation with CMP files

Select changes can also be synced from the PCB back to the schematic by
exporting a CMP file from the PCB editor (**File** → **Export** →
**Footprint Association (.cmp) File…​**) and importing it in the
Schematic Editor (**File** → **Import** → **Footprint Assignments…​**).

<div class="note">

This method can only sync changes made to footprint assignments and
footprint fields. It is recommended to use the Update Schematic from PCB
tool instead.

</div>

## Geographical re-annotation

The Geographical Reannotation tool lets you automatically set the
reference designators of footprints based on their physical location on
the board.

To run the Geographical Reannotation tool, use **Tools** →
**Geographical Reannotate…​**. This opens the geographical reannotation
dialog with options for how to perform the reannotation.

<figure>
<img src="images/geographical_reannotate_options.png"
alt="geographical reannotate options" />
</figure>

The **Options** tab contains settings for how footprint locations affect
reannotation. The arrow diagrams indicate which geographical ordering to
use when reannotating. You can reannotate from left-to-right,
right-to-left, top-to-bottom, or bottom-to-top, and you can select
whether to use a column-major order (go through all footprints in the
same column before moving to the next column) or row-major order (go
through all footprints in the same row before moving to the next row).

Geographical reannotation can either use the location of the footprint
itself or the location of the footprint’s reference designator. You can
also select how much to round footprint locations before determining
which footprints are at the same X or Y position. Rounding to a finer
coordinate resolution will result in fewer footprints considered to be
in the same row or column.

Finally, you can select which footprints to reannotate. You can
reannotate all footprints on the board, all footprints on the front or
back of the board, or all footprints in your selection.

<figure>
<img src="images/geographical_reannotate_reference_designators.png"
alt="geographical reannotate reference designators" />
</figure>

The **Reference Designators** tab contains options for how to allocate
new reference designators. There are separate settings for footprints on
the front and back of the board.

**Reference start** controls the number for the first new reference
designator on each side of the board. If no start value is given for the
back of the board, back side footprints will be annotated starting at
one higher than the last front side reference designator.

**Prefix** specifies a prefix string to insert at the beginning of each
newly assigned reference designator. This prefix will be inserted before
any prefix that is already present. If the **remove prefix** option is
selected, footprints with the specified prefix will instead have that
prefix removed instead of added. Footprints without that prefix will not
have not have any prefix added or removed.

If **exclude locked footprints** is checked, locked footprints will not
be reannotated. You can also avoid reannotating specific footprints by
entering their reference designators as a comma-separated list in the
**exclude references** box.

When you click the **Reannotate PCB** button, footprints will be
reannotated according to the selected settings.

<div class="note">

The Geographical Reannotation tool updates reference designators in the
board, but not in the schematic. After geographically reannotating the
board, be sure to sync the updated reference designators to the
schematic by running the [Update Schematic from
PCB](#forward-and-back-annotation) tool with the **re-link footprints to
schematic symbols based on their reference designators** option
disabled. If the schematic is not updated, reference designators in the
board will not match those in the schematic.
