# Introduction to the KiCad Schematic Editor

The KiCad Schematic Editor is a schematic capture application
distributed as a part of KiCad and available for the following operating
systems:

- Linux

- Apple macOS

- Windows

Regardless of the OS, all KiCad files are 100% compatible from one OS to
another.

The Schematic Editor is an integrated application where all functions of
schematic drawing, PCB footprint selection, library management, and data
transfer to and from the PCB design software are carried out within the
editor itself.

The KiCad Schematic Editor is intended to communicate directly with the
KiCad PCB Editor for designing printed circuit boards without using any
intermediate files. It can also export netlist files, which list all the
electrical connections, for other packages.

The Schematic Editor includes a symbol library editor, which can create
and edit symbols and manage libraries. It also integrates the following
additional but essential functions needed for modern schematic capture
software:

- Electrical rules check (ERC) for automatic detection of incorrect and
  missing connections

- Circuit simulation using ngspice

- Export of plot files in many formats (Postscript, PDF, HPGL, and SVG)

- Bill of Materials generation (via Python or XSLT scripts, which allow
  many flexible formats).

The Schematic Editor supports multi-sheet schematics in several ways:

- Flat hierarchies (schematic sheets are not explicitly connected in a
  master diagram).

- Simple hierarchies (each schematic sheet is used only once).

- Complex hierarchies (some schematic sheets are used multiple times).

Hierarchical schematics are described in detail [later in the
manual](#hierarchical-schematics).

## Initial Configuration

When the Schematic Editor is run for the first time, if the the global
symbol library table file `sym-lib-table` is not found in the KiCad
configuration folder then KiCad will ask how to create this file:

<figure>
<img src="images/en/symbol-lib-table-configuration.png"
style="width:80.0%" alt="symbol library table initial configuration" />
</figure>

The first option is recommended (**Copy default global symbol library
table (recommended)**). The default symbol library table includes all of
the standard symbol libraries that are installed as part of KiCad.

If this option is disabled, KiCad was unable to find the default global
symbol library table. This probably means you did not install the
standard symbol libraries with KiCad, or they are not installed where
KiCad expects to find them. On some systems the KiCad libraries are
installed as a separate package.

- If you have installed the standard KiCad symbol libraries and want to
  use them, but the first option is disabled, select the second option
  and browse to the `sym-lib-table` file in the directory where the
  KiCad libraries were installed.

- If you already have a custom symbol library table that you would like
  to use, select the second option and browse to your `sym-lib-table`
  file.

- If you want to construct a new symbol library table from scratch,
  select the third option.

Symbol library management, including how to re-run this initial
configuration, is described in more detail
[later](#managing-symbol-libraries).

## The Schematic Editor User Interface

<figure>
<img src="images/en/commands_overview.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Schematic Editor overview" />
</figure>

The main Schematic Editor user interface is shown above. The center
contains the main editing canvas, which is surrounded by:

- Top toolbars (file management, zoom tools, editing tools)

- Left toolbar (display options), [Hierarchy
  Navigator](#navigating-between-sheets), [Properties
  Manager](#properties-manager), and the [selection filter](#selection)
  at left

- Message panel and status bar at bottom

- Right toolbar (drawing and design tools) and [Design Block
  panel](#schematic-design-blocks) at right

## Navigating the editing canvas

The editing canvas displays the schematic being designed. You can pan
and zoom to different parts of the schematic and open any schematic
sheet in the design.

By default, dragging with the middle or right mouse button will pan the
canvas view and scrolling the mouse wheel will zoom the view in or out.
You can change this behavior in the Mouse and Touchpad section of the
preferences (see [Configuration and
Customization](#configuration-and-customization) for details).

Several other zoom tools are available in the top toolbar:

- ![Zoom In icon](images/icons/zoom_in_24.png) zooms in on the center of
  the viewport.

- ![Zoom Out icon](images/icons/zoom_out_24.png) zooms out from the
  center of the viewport.

- ![Zoom to Page icon](images/icons/zoom_fit_in_page_24.png) zooms to
  fit the frame around the drawing sheet.

- ![Zoom to Objects icon](images/icons/zoom_fit_to_objects_24.png) zooms
  to fit every item in the schematic (not including the drawing sheet).
  For instance, if there are items placed outside of the drawing sheet,
  they will be visible after zooming to objects.

- ![Zoom to Selection icon](images/icons/zoom_area_24.png) allows you to
  draw a box to determine the zoomed area.

The cursor’s current position is displayed at the bottom of the window
(X and Y), along with the current zoom factor (Z), the cursor’s relative
position (dx, dy, and dist), the grid setting, and the display units.

The relative coordinates can be reset to zero by pressing Space. This is
useful for measuring distance between two points or aligning objects.

## Hotkeys

The <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+F1</span> shortcut displays the current
hotkey list. The default hotkey list is included in the [Actions
Reference](#eeschema-actions-reference) section of the manual.

The hotkeys described in this manual use the key labels that appear on a
standard PC keyboard. On an Apple keyboard layout, use the Cmd key in
place of Ctrl, and the Option key in place of Alt.

Many actions do not have hotkeys assigned by default, but hotkeys can be
assigned or redefined using the hotkey editor (**Preferences** →
**Preferences…​** → **[Hotkeys](#preferences-controls)**).

<div class="note">

Many of the actions available through hotkeys are also available in
context menus. To access the context menu, right-click in the editing
canvas. Different actions will be available depending on what is
selected or what tool is active.

</div>

Hotkeys are stored in the file `user.hotkeys` in KiCad’s configuration
directory. The location is platform-specific:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\kicad\9.0\user.hotkeys`

- Linux: `~/.config/kicad/9.0/user.hotkeys`

- macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/kicad/9.0/user.hotkeys`

KiCad can import hotkey settings from a `user.hotkeys` file using the
**Import Hotkeys** button in the hotkey editor.

## Selection and the selection filter

Selecting items in the editing canvas is done with the left mouse
button. Single-clicking on an object will select it. Clicking and
dragging will perform a box selection. A box selection from left to
right will only select items that are fully inside the box. A box
selection from right to left will select any items that touch the box. A
left-to-right selection box is drawn in yellow, with a cursor that
indicates exclusive selection, and a right-to-left selection box is
drawn in blue with a cursor that indicates inclusive selection.

The selection action can be modified by holding modifier keys while
clicking or dragging. The following modifier keys apply when clicking to
select single items:

| Modifier Keys (Windows)                  | Modifier Keys (Linux)                    | Modifier Keys (macOS)                   | Selection Effect                             |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl                                     | Ctrl                                     | Cmd                                     | Toggle selection.                            |
| Shift                                    | Shift                                    | Shift                                   | Add the item to the existing selection.      |
| <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Cmd+Shift</span> | Remove the item from the existing selection. |
| long click                               | long click or Alt                        | long click or Option                    | Clarify selection from a pop-up menu.        |

The following modifier keys apply when dragging to perform a box
selection:

| Modifier Keys (Windows)                  | Modifier Keys (Linux)                    | Modifier Keys (macOS)                   | Selection Effect                            |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl                                     | Ctrl                                     | Cmd                                     | Toggle selection.                           |
| Shift                                    | Shift                                    | Shift                                   | Add item(s) to the existing selection.      |
| <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift</span> | <span class="keycombo">Cmd+Shift</span> | Remove item(s) from the existing selection. |

The selection filter panel in the lower left corner of the Schematic
Editor window controls which types of objects can be selected with the
mouse. Turning off selection of unwanted object types makes it easier to
select items in a busy schematic. The "All items" checkbox is a shortcut
to turn the other items on and off. You can right-click any object type
in the selection filter to quickly change the filter to only allow
selecting that type of object.

<figure>
<img src="images/selection_filter.png" alt="selection filter" />
</figure>

Selecting an object displays information about the object in the message
panel at the bottom of the window. Double-clicking an object opens a
window to edit the object’s properties.

Pressing Esc will always cancel the current tool or operation and return
to the selection tool. Pressing Esc while the selection tool is active
will clear the current selection.

# Schematic Creation and Editing

## Introduction

A schematic designed with KiCad is more than a simple graphic
representation of an electronic device. It is normally the entry point
of a development chain that allows for:

- Validating against a set of rules ([Electrical Rules Check](#erc)) to
  detect errors and omissions.

- Automatically generating a [bill of
  materials](#creating-customized-netlists-and-bom-files).

- [Generating a netlist](#creating-customized-netlists-and-bom-files)
  for simulation software such as SPICE.

- [Defining a circuit](#creating-customized-netlists-and-bom-files) for
  transferring to PCB layout.

A schematic mainly consists of symbols, wires, labels, junctions, buses
and power symbols. For clarity in the schematic, you can place purely
graphical elements like bus entries, comments, and polylines.

Symbols are added to the schematic from symbol libraries. After the
schematic is made, the set of connections and footprints is imported
into the PCB editor for designing a board.

Schematics can be contained in a single sheet or split among multiple
sheets. In KiCad, multi-sheet schematics are organized hierarchically,
with a root sheet and sub-sheet(s). Each sheet is its own `.kicad_sch`
file and is itself a complete KiCad schematic. Working with hierarchical
schematics is described in the [Hierarchical
Schematics](#hierarchical-schematics) chapter.

## Schematic editing operations

Schematic editing tools are located in the right toolbar. When a tool is
activated, it stays active until a different tool is selected or the
tool is canceled with the Esc key. The selection tool is always
activated when any other tool is canceled.

## Grids and snapping

Schematic elements such as symbols, wires, text, and graphic lines are
snapped to the grid when moving, dragging, and drawing them.
Additionally, the wire and label tools snap to other connected items
such as pins, wires, and labels even when grid snapping is disabled.

Both grid and connected object snapping can be disabled while moving the
mouse by using the modifier keys in the table below.

<div class="note">

On Apple keyboards, use the Cmd key instead of Ctrl.

</div>

| Modifier Key | Effect                             |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Ctrl         | Disable grid snapping.             |
| Shift        | Disable connected object snapping. |

The default grid size is 50 mil (0.050") or 1.27 millimeters. This is
the recommended grid for placing symbols and wires in a schematic and
for placing pins when designing a symbol in the Symbol Editor. Smaller
grids can also be used, but this is intended only for text and symbol
graphics, and not recommended for placing pins and wires.

<div class="note">

Wires connect with other wires or pins only if their ends coincide
**exactly**. Therefore it is very important to keep symbol pins and
wires aligned to the grid. It is recommended to always use a 50 mil grid
when placing symbols and drawing wires because the KiCad standard symbol
library and all libraries that follow its style also use a 50 mil grid.
**Using a grid size other than 50 mil will result in schematics without
proper connectivity!**

</div>

<div class="note">

Symbols, wires, and other elements that are not aligned to the grid can
be snapped back to the grid by selecting them, right clicking, and
clicking **Align Elements to Grid**.

</div>

You can adjust the grid size by right-clicking and selecting a new grid
from the list in the **Grid** submenu. Pressing the n or N hotkeys will
cycle to the next and previous grid in the list, respectively.

You can also select a new grid or edit the available grids in the
**Grids** pane of the preferences dialog. As a shortcut to reach this
dialog, right click the ![show grid button](images/icons/grid_24.png)
button on the left toolbar and select **Edit Grids…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/grid_panel.png" alt="grid settings dialog" />
</figure>

In this dialog you can select an active grid from the list of grids,
reorder the list of grids (![small up 16](images/icons/small_up_16.png)
/ ![small down 16](images/icons/small_down_16.png)), and add (![small
plus 16](images/icons/small_plus_16.png)), remove (![small trash
16](images/icons/small_trash_16.png)), or edit (![small edit
16](images/icons/small_edit_16.png)) grids. Grids defined in this dialog
can have unequal X and Y spacing as well as an optional name. The grid
spacing and name are specified when you create or edit a grid.

This dialog also lets you designate two grids from the list as "Fast
Grids", which can be quickly selected using
<span class="keycombo">Alt+1</span> and
<span class="keycombo">Alt+2</span>.

Finally, you can configure grid overrides for different types of
objects. Grid overrides let you set particular grid sizes for different
types of objects which will be used instead of the default grid when
working with those objects. For example, you can set a 50 mil grid for
wires and connected items while using smaller grids to finely position
text and graphics. Grid overrides can be individually enabled and
disabled in this dialog, or globally enabled and disabled using the
![grid override enable button](images/icons/grid_override_24.png) button
on the left toolbar (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+G</span>).

The visual appearance of the grid can also be customized in several
ways. You can change the thickness of the grid markings, switch their
shape (dots, lines, or crosses), and set the minimum displayed spacing
in the **Display Options** page of the preferences dialog, and you can
change the grid color in the **Colors** page of the preferences dialog.

The grid can be shown or hidden using the ![show grid
button](images/icons/grid_24.png) button on the left-hand toolbar. By
default the grid is still active even if it is hidden, but this is
configurable in the **Display Options** preferences page. There you can
set the grid to be disabled when it is hidden or even disable the grid
entirely.

## Editing object properties

All objects have properties that are editable in a dialog. Use the
hotkey E or select **Properties** from the right-click context menu to
edit the properties of selected item(s). You can only open the
properties dialog if all the items you have selected are of the same
type. For many object types, like symbols, you can only edit the
properties of a single item at one time. To edit the properties of
multiple items at once, including items with different types, you can
use the Properties Manager.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/dialog_component_properties.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Symbol Properties dialog" />
</figure>

You can only use the properties dialog to edit one item at a time. To
edit multiple items, use the Properties Manager, described below. There
are also other tools that can be used to edit specific types of objects
in bulk, such as the [Edit Text and Graphics
tool](#eeschema-edit-text-and-graphics-properties) for editing visual
properties of text, symbol fields, labels, and graphic shapes, or the
[Symbol Fields Table](#symbol-fields-table) for editing symbol fields in
bulk.

You can also view and edit item properties using the Properties Manager.
The Properties Manager is a docked panel that displays the properties of
the selected item or items for editing. If multiple types of items are
selected at once, the properties panel displays only the properties
shared by all of the selected item types.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_properties_manager.png"
alt="Properties Manager showing properties for a symbol" />
</figure>

Editing a property in the Properties Manager immediately applies the
change. When multiple items are selected, property modifications are
applied to each selected item individually, not to the whole selection
as a group. For example, when changing the orientation of multiple
items, each item is individually rotated around its own origin, not the
group’s origin.

Show the Properties Manager with **View** → **Panels** → **Properties**
or the ![Properties Manager icon](images/icons/tools_24.png) button on
the left toolbar.

In properties dialogs and many other dialogs, any field that contains a
numeric value can also accept a basic math expression that results in a
numeric value. For example, a dimension may be entered as `2 * 2mm`,
resulting in a value of `4mm`. Basic arithmetic operators as well as
parentheses for defining order of operations are supported.

## Working with symbols

### Placing symbols

To place a symbol in your schematic, use the ![New Symbol
icon](images/icons/add_component_24.png) button or the A hotkey. The
Choose Symbols dialog appears and lets you select a symbol to add.
Symbols are grouped by symbol library.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/dialog_choose_component.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Choose Component dialog" />
</figure>

By default, only the symbol/library name and description columns are
shown. Additional columns can be added by right-clicking the column
header and selecting **Select Columns**.

The Choose Symbol dialog filters symbols by name, keywords, description,
and all additional symbol fields according to what you type into the
search field. You can choose to sort search results alphabetically or by
best match by clicking on the ![sort
button](images/icons/small_sort_desc_16.png) button.

Some advanced filters are available:

- **Wildcards:** `*` matches any number of any characters, including
  none, and `?` matches any single character.

- **Key-value pairs:** if a library part’s description or keywords
  contain a tag of the format "Key:123", you can match relative to that
  by typing "Key\>123" (greater than), "Key\<123" (less than), etc.
  Numbers may include one of the following case-insensitive suffixes:

  |                  |                 |                 |                 |                |                |                |                 |
  |------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
  | p                | n               | u               | m               | k              | meg            | g              | t               |
  | 10<sup>-12</sup> | 10<sup>-9</sup> | 10<sup>-6</sup> | 10<sup>-3</sup> | 10<sup>3</sup> | 10<sup>6</sup> | 10<sup>9</sup> | 10<sup>12</sup> |

  |                |                |                |                |
  |----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
  | ki             | mi             | gi             | ti             |
  | 2<sup>10</sup> | 2<sup>20</sup> | 2<sup>30</sup> | 2<sup>40</sup> |

- **Regular expressions:** if you’re familiar with regular expressions,
  these can be used too. The regular expression flavor used is the
  [wxWidgets Advanced Regular Expression
  style](http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_resyntax.html), which is
  similar to Perl regular expressions.

If the symbol specifies a default footprint, this footprint will be
previewed in the lower right. If the symbol includes footprint filters,
alternate footprints that satisfy the footprint filters can be selected
in the footprint dropdown menu at right.

After selecting a symbol to place, the symbol will be attached to the
cursor. Left clicking the desired location in the schematic places the
symbol into the schematic. Before placing the symbol in the schematic,
you can rotate it, mirror it, and edit its fields, by either using the
hotkeys or the right-click context menu. These actions can also be
performed after placement.

If the **Place repeated copies** option is checked, after placing a
symbol KiCad will start placing another copy of the symbol. This process
continues until the user presses Esc.

For symbols with multiple units, if the **Place all units** option is
checked, after placing the symbol KiCad will start placing the next unit
in the symbol. This continues until the last unit has been placed or the
user presses Esc.

### Placing power symbols

A [power symbol](#power-symbols) is a symbol representing a connection
to a power net. The symbols are grouped in the `power` library, so they
can be placed using the symbol chooser. However, as power placements are
frequent, the ![Add Power icon](images/icons/add_power_24.png) tool is
available. This tool is similar, except that the search is done directly
in the `power` library and any other library that contains power
symbols.

### Moving symbols

Symbols can be moved using the Move (M) or Drag (G) tools. These tools
act on the selected symbol, or if no symbol is selected they act on the
symbol under the cursor.

The **Move** tool moves the symbol itself without maintaining wired
connections to the symbol pins.

The **Drag** tool moves the symbol without breaking wired connections to
its pins, and therefore moves the connected wires as well.

You can also Drag symbols by clicking and dragging them with the mouse,
depending on the **Left button drag gesture** setting in the **Mouse and
Touchpad** section of Preferences.

Symbols can also be rotated (R) or mirrored in the X (X) or Y (Y)
directions.

### Editing symbol properties

Symbols in the schematic can be individually edited, both in terms of
their properties (fields, attributes, etc.) and in terms of their pins
and graphics. Editing a symbol in the schematic only affects that
particular instance of the symbol; it does not affect any other copies
of that symbol in the schematic, and it does not affect the library
symbol.

To edit the properties of a symbol in the schematic, open its properties
dialog (E). You can also double-click the symbol.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/dialog_component_properties.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Symbol Properties dialog" />
</figure>

The Symbol Properties window displays all the fields of a symbol in a
table. New fields can be added, and existing fields can be deleted,
edited, reordered, moved, or resized. Fields can be arbitrarily named,
but names beginning with `ki_`, e.g. `ki_description`, are reserved by
KiCad and should not be used for user fields. All symbol fields will be
added to the symbol’s corresponding footprint when the [PCB is updated
from the schematic](#schematic-to-pcb).

Each field’s name and value can be visible or hidden, and there are
several formatting options: horizontal and vertical alignment,
orientation, position, font, text color, text size, and bold/italic
emphasis. Field autoplacement can also be enabled on a per-field basis.
The displayed position is always indicated for a normally displayed
symbol (no rotation or mirroring) and is relative to the anchor point of
the symbol.

<div class="note">

Formatting options for symbol fields can be shown or hidden by
right-clicking on the header row of the symbol field table and enabling
or disabling the desired columns. Not all columns are shown by default.

</div>

Several fields have special behavior:

- The **Footprint** field defines which footprint will correspond to the
  symbol in the board design. When the footprint field is selected, you
  can click the ![small library 16](images/icons/small_library_16.png)
  button to open the [footprint
  chooser](#assigning-footprints-in-symbol-properties) to assign a
  footprint to the symbol. See the [Assigning
  Footprints](#assigning-footprints) section for other ways to assign
  footprints.

- The **Datasheet** field can contain the manufacturer’s datasheet for
  the symbol. You can right click a symbol in the editing canvas and
  choose **Show Datasheet** (D) to open the datasheet listed in the
  symbol. A symbol’s datasheet can be a local file or a file at a remote
  URL, like the manufacturer’s website. You can choose a local file
  using a file browser by selecting the datasheet field in the symbol’s
  properties, then clicking the ![www 16](images/icons/www_16.png)
  button. If you enable the **Embed File** checkbox in the file browser,
  the datasheet will be embedded in the schematic instead of being
  referenced as an an external file. This means the datasheet will be
  available on any computer. For more information, see the [embedded
  files documentation](#sch-embedding-files).

Symbols have several attributes that affect how the symbols are treated
by other parts of KiCad.

- **Exclude from simulation** prevents the symbol from being included in
  SPICE simulations. Symbols that are excluded from simulation are drawn
  with a grey outline around them and a simulation waveform icon to
  their bottom right, as shown below. The color of the outline and icon
  is configurable by editing the "Excluded-from-simulation Markers"
  color in the selected colorscheme. The visual marker (the outline and
  the icon) can be disabled completely by disabling **View** → **Mark
  items which are excluded from simulation**.

<figure>
<img src="images/exclude_from_sim_symbol.png"
alt="Symbol with Exclude From Simulation property set" />
</figure>

- **Exclude from bill of materials** prevents the component from being
  included in [BOM exports](#bom-export).

- **Exclude from board** means that the symbol is schematic-only, and a
  corresponding footprint will not be added to the PCB.

- **Do not populate** means that the component should not be attached to
  the PCB, although a corresponding footprint should still be added to
  the board. DNP symbols appear desaturated and with a red "X" over them
  in the schematic, as shown below. The color of the "X" is configurable
  by editing the "DNP Markers" color in the selected colorscheme.

<figure>
<img src="images/dnp_symbol.png" style="width:30.0%"
alt="Symbol with DNP property set" />
</figure>

To edit the symbols’s form, i.e. its pins and graphics, you need to use
the [symbol editor](#creating-and-editing-symbols). There are two
buttons for opening a symbol in the editor, depending on whether you
want to edit a single copy of a symbol in the schematic or a symbol’s
source copy in the library.

- **Edit Symbol…​** will open the specific instance of the symbol in the
  symbol editor. Editing this symbol will only affect this one instance
  of the symbol in the schematic. It will not affect other instances of
  the symbol in the schematic, and it will not affect the library copy
  of the symbol. You can also open a schematic symbol in the symbol
  editor by right clicking the symbol in the schematic and selecting
  **Edit with symbol editor** (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+E</span>).

- **Edit Library Symbol…​** will open the library copy of the symbol in
  the symbol editor. Editing the library copy of the symbol will edit
  the symbol in the symbol library, but will not immediately affect any
  instances of that symbol in the schematic. To update symbols in the
  schematic with changes to the library symbol, use the **Update Symbol
  from Library…​** tool. Editing the library symbol in this way is
  equivalent to opening the symbol editor, opening the appropriate
  symbol in its library, and editing it.

The **Update Symbol from Library…​** button is used to update the
schematic’s copy of the symbol to match the copy in the library. The
**Change Symbol…​** button is used to swap the current symbol to a
different symbol in the library. These functions are described
[later](#updating-and-exchanging-symbols).

The **Simulation Model…​** button opens the [Simulation Model
Editor](#simulation-model-editor) for specifying the symbol’s behavior
in [SPICE simulations](#simulator).

#### Editing symbol fields individually

An individual symbol text field can be edited directly with the E hotkey
(with a field selected instead of a symbol) or by double-clicking on the
field.

Some symbol fields have their own hotkey to edit them directly. With the
symbol selected, the Reference, Value, and Footprint fields can be
edited with the U, V, or F hotkeys, respectively.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/dialog_edit_reference_field.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Edit Reference Field dialog" />
</figure>

The options in this dialog are the same as those in the full Symbol
Properties dialog, but are specific to a single field.

Symbol fields can be automatically moved to an appropriate location with
the Autoplace Fields action (select a symbol and press O). Field
autoplacement is configurable in the Schematic Editor’s Editing Options,
including a setting to always autoplace fields. You can also disable
autoplacement for individual fields in the Symbol Properties or Field
Properties dialogs.

### Alternate pin functions

Symbol pins can have alternate pin functions defined for them. Alternate
pin functions allow you to select a different name, electrical type, and
graphical style for a pin when a symbol has been placed in the
schematic. This can be used for pins that have multiple functions, such
as microcontroller pins.

Alternate pin functions are selected once a symbol has been placed in
the schematic. The pin function is selected in the **Pin Functions** tab
of the Symbol Properties dialog. Alternate definitions are selectable in
the dropdown in the Alternate Assignment column. You can also select an
alternate pin by right-clicking the pin and selecting a new function
from the **Pin Function** menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_alternate_pin_assignment_selection.png"
style="width:60.0%" alt="Selecting an alternate pin definition" />
</figure>

Pins that have alternate functions available are displayed with a small
graphical indicator next to the pin name, as shown in the screenshot
below. To globally show or hide these indicators, use **View** → **Show
Pin Alternate Icons**.

<figure>
<img src="images/alternate_pin_function_indicator.png"
alt="alternate pin function indicator" />
</figure>

For information on how to add alternate pin functions to symbols, see
the [symbol editor documentation](#alternate-pin-definitions).

### Updating and exchanging symbols

When a symbol is added to the schematic, KiCad embeds a copy of the
library symbol in the schematic so that the schematic is independent of
the system libraries. Symbols that have been added to the schematic are
not automatically updated when the library changes. Library symbol
changes are manually synced to the schematic so that the schematic does
not change unexpectedly.

<div class="note">

You can use the [Compare Symbol with Library tool](#comparing-symbols)
to inspect the differences between a symbol in a schematic with its
corresponding library symbol.

</div>

To update symbols in the schematic to match the corresponding library
symbol, use **Tools** → **Update Symbols from Library…​**, or right click
a symbol and select **Update Symbol…​**. You can also access the tool
from the [symbol properties dialog](#editing-symbol-properties).

<figure>
<img src="images/update_symbol_dialog.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="update symbol from library dialog" />
</figure>

The top of the dialog has options to choose which symbols will be
updated:

- **Update all symbols in schematic**: all symbols in the schematic will
  be updated to match the library versions of the symbols.

- **Update selected symbol(s)**: symbols that are selected in the
  schematic will be updated.

- **Update symbols matching reference designator**: symbols matching the
  specified reference designator will be updated. The reference
  designator field supports wildcards: `*` matches any number of any
  characters, including none, and `?` matches any single character.

- **Update symbols matching value**: symbols with the specified value
  will be updated. The value field supports wildcards: `*` matches any
  number of any characters, including none, and `?` matches any single
  character.

- **Update symbols matching library identifier**: symbols that match the
  specified library identifier will be updated. Library identifiers
  consist of the symbol library name and the symbol name, separated by
  `:`.

The middle of the dialog has options to control what parts of the symbol
will be updated. On the left, you can select which fields will be
modified (updated or reset). On the right, you can select how to update
those fields:

- **Remove fields if not in library symbol**: if selected, any fields
  that are in the schematic version of the symbol but not the library
  version will be deleted.

- **Reset fields if empty in library symbol**: if selected, any fields
  that are empty in the library version of the symbol will be set to
  empty in the schematic version of the symbol.

- **Update/reset field text**: if selected, field contents in the
  schematic version of the symbol will be updated to match the fields in
  the library version of the symbol. Any fields that are empty in the
  library version of the symbol will not be updated unless **Reset
  fields if empty in library symbol** is selected.

- **Update/reset field visibilities**: if selected, fields in the
  schematic version of the symbol will have their visibility updated to
  match the library version of the symbol.

- **Update/reset field text sizes and styles**: if selected, fields in
  the schematic version of the symbol will have their text sizes and
  styles updated to match the library version of the symbol.

- **Update/reset field positions**: if selected, fields in the schematic
  version of the symbol will be moved to match the locations of the
  fields in the library version of the symbol.

- **Update symbol shape and pins**: the symbol’s shape and pins are
  always updated to match the library version of the symbol.

- **Update keywords and footprint filters**: The symbol’s keywords and
  footprint filters are always updated to match the library version of
  the symbol.

- **Update/reset visibility of pin names/numbers**: if selected, the
  visibility of pin names and numbers in the schematic version of the
  symbol will be updated to match the visibility of the pin names and
  numbers in the library version of the symbol.

- **Reset alternate pin functions**: if selected, alternate pin
  functions selected for the symbol’s pins will be reset to default pin
  functions.

- **Update/reset symbol attributes**: if selected, the schematic symbol
  attributes (**do not populate**, **exclude from simulation**,
  **exclude from BOM**, **exclude from board**) will be updated to match
  the library version of the symbol.

- **Reset custom power symbols**: if selected, the `Value` field of
  [power symbols](#power-symbols) in the schematic will be updated to
  match the library versions of the symbols. If not selected, the
  `Value` field of power symbols will not be updated, even if the
  `Value` field of other non-power symbols would be updated. Note that
  changing the `Value` field of power symbols will change the global net
  associated with the power symbol.

The bottom of the dialog displays messages describing the update actions
that have been performed, with filters for which types of messages to
display (errors, warnings, actions, and/or infos).

To change an existing symbol to a different symbol, use **Edit** →
**Change Symbols…​**, or right click an existing symbol and select
**Change Symbol…​**. This dialog is also accessible from the [symbol
properties dialog](#editing-symbol-properties).

<figure>
<img src="images/change_symbol_dialog.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="change symbol dialog" />
</figure>

The options for the Change Symbols dialog are very similar to the Update
Symbols from Library dialog.

Another way to swap existing symbols for new ones is to use **Tools** →
**Edit Symbol Library Links…​**. This dialog contains a table of every
symbol in the design, grouped by current library symbol. By choosing a
new symbol in the **New Library Reference** column, you can make all
instances of the existing symbol instead point to the new symbol. If the
**Update symbol fields from new library** option is used, the contents
of the existing symbols' fields will be updated to match the new
symbols' fields.

The **Map Orphans** button attempts to automatically remap orphaned
symbols to symbols with the same name in an active library. For example,
if there is a symbol with the current library reference
`mylib:symbol123`, but the `mylib` library cannot be found, the **Map
Orphans** button will attempt to find a symbol named `symbol123` in any
of the libraries that are present. This button is only enabled if
orphaned symbols are present in the schematic (see the [legacy
schematics](#opening-legacy-schematics) section).

<figure>
<img src="images/symbol_library_links_dialog.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="change symbol dialog" />
</figure>

This dialog is primarily useful for managing symbols that appear in
multiple libraries, when you want to switch from one library to another.
For example, if a schematic uses symbols that are in both a global
library and a project-specific library, the Symbol Library References
dialog could be used to switch between using the global symbols or the
equivalent project-specific symbols. It does not have features for
fine-grained control of how fields are updated; for that, use the Change
Symbols dialog.

### Comparing symbols between schematic and library

When a symbol in a schematic diverges from the corresponding symbol in
the original symbol library, you can use the Compare Symbol with Library
tool to inspect the differences between the two versions of the symbol.
Run the tool using **Inspect** → **Compare Symbol With Library**.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_compare_symbol_with_library_summary.png"
alt="Compare Symbol with Library Summary tab" />
</figure>

The **Summary** tab shows the name of the symbol, including its library
and schematic reference designator, and provides a list of the
differences between the schematic and library versions of the symbol.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_compare_symbol_with_library_visual.png"
alt="Compare Symbol with Library Visual tab" />
</figure>

The **Visual** tab shows a visual comparison of the schematic and
library versions of the symbol. This can be used as a visual diff tool.

By default, the comparison displays both versions of the symbol
superimposed on each other. To see the changes more easily, you can drag
the slider at the bottom of the tab to the right to emphasize the
library version of the symbol in the superimposed view (making the
schematic version of the symbol more transparent) or drag it to the left
to emphasize the schematic version (making the library version more
transparent). At the far right and left ends of the slider, the
schematic and library versions of the symbol, respectively, are fully
hidden. It may be helpful to drag the slider back and forth to see the
changes more clearly.

You can press the **A/B** button, or use the / hotkey, to quickly toggle
back and forth between the schematic and library versions.

The screenshot above shows a visual comparison with the schematic
version of the symbol deemphasized. You can see a partially transparent
pin 5 (from the schematic version of the symbol) is in a different
location than the fully opaque pin 5 (from the library symbol). This
indicates that the pin was moved in either the schematic or library
version of the symbol.

### Symbol Fields Table

The Symbol Fields Table allows you to view and modify field values for
all symbols in a spreadsheet interface. You can open the Symbol Fields
Table with the ![Symbol Fields Table
icon](images/icons/spreadsheet_24.png) button.

<figure>
<img src="images/symbol_fields_table_edit.png"
alt="Symbol Fields Table" />
</figure>

Cells are navigated with the arrow keys, or with Tab /
<span class="keycombo">Shift+Tab</span> to move right / left and Enter
to move down, respectively.

A range of cells can be selected by clicking and dragging. The whole
range of selected cells will be copied
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+C</span>) or pasted into
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+V</span>) on a copy or paste action.
Copying a range of cells from the table can be useful for creating a
BOM. More details of copying and pasting cells are described below.

The left pane contains a list of all available symbol fields, as well as
some [virtual fields](#symbol-fields-table-virtual-fields) such as
Quantity and Item Number. You can add or remove any symbol field from
the main table on using the **Show** checkboxes (fields can also be
shown or hidden by right-clicking on the header of the main table). New
symbol fields can be added using the ![plus
icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) button; a field with that name
will be added to every symbol. To rename the field, which changes the
field name in all symbols, use the ![pencil
icon](images/icons/small_edit_16.png) button. The ![delete
icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button deletes the field from all
symbols.

Each field has its own column label, which is displayed at the top of
the corresponding column in the symbol fields table and in exported
BOMs. The column label for each field is shown in the second column of
in the left pane. A column label does not have to match the field name.
To change a field’s column label, select the field’s row in the left
pane, then click again in the column label cell of that row to edit it.

Similar symbols can optionally be grouped by any symbol field using the
**Group By** checkboxes. Symbols are grouped into a single row in the
table if all of their **Group By** fields are identical. The grouped row
can be expanded to show the individual symbols by clicking the arrow at
the left of the row. The **Group Symbols** checkbox enables or disables
symbol grouping, and the ![refresh
icon](images/icons/small_refresh_16.png) button recalculates groupings.

Presets are available to configure the list of fields. Presets store
which fields are displayed, which fields are used for grouping, and the
column order. You can create and save your own presets or use one of
several default presets. Custom presets can be deleted in this dialog or
in the [Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup) dialog.

Symbols can be filtered by reference designator using the **Filter**
textbox at the top. The filter supports wildcards: `*` matches any
number of any characters, including none, and `?` matches any single
character. You can also change the display scope, showing only symbols
in the current sheet, the current sheet and all of its subsheets, or the
entire project. Symbols with the DNP (do not populate) attribute set can
be optionally excluded by checking the **Exclude DNP** box.

You can cross-probe from this dialog by selecting a row in the table.
Depending on the **Cross-probe action** setting at the bottom of the
dialog, this can highlight the corresponding symbol in the schematic,
select the corresponding symbol in the schematic, or do nothing. The
selection action can also select the symbol’s footprint in the board
editor, depending on the PCB Editor cross-probing settings.

The Symbol Fields Table is also a bill of materials tool. You can use
the **Export** button to save the symbol fields to an external file. The
fields are exported to the BOM exactly as they are currently shown in
the spreadsheet view. File format settings are configured in the
**Export** tab. For more information about exporting a BOM, see the [BOM
tool documentation](#bom-export).

#### Virtual fields

If you create a field in the Symbol Fields Table whose name begins with
a [text variable](#text-variables), a virtual field will be created.
Virtual fields have a value that is evaluated for each symbol based on
the contents of the field name. For example, a virtual field named
`${SYMBOL_NAME}` will evaluate to the symbol’s name for each symbol. A
virtual field can contain any text, as long as it starts with a text
variable, so a virtual field named `${SYMBOL_LIBRARY}:${SYMBOL_NAME}`
will evaluate to `<library name>:<symbol name>` for each symbol.

Virtual fields exist only in the Symbol Fields Table and in BOM exports.
While they are displayed as a column in the dialog and BOMs, and they
can be used to group or sort symbols in BOM exports just like regular
fields, adding a virtual field in the Symbol Fields Table does not add a
corresponding field to each symbol in the schematic.

Any [text variable](#text-variables) can be used in virtual fields,
including sheet and project text variables.

Text variables that correspond to symbol attributes (`${DNP}`,
`${EXCLUDE_FROM_BOARD}`, `${EXCLUDE_FROM_SIM}`, `${EXCLUDE_FROM_BOM}`)
are displayed specially. In the Symbol Fields Table, they are shown as
checkboxes for each symbol that directly set or unset the corresponding
symbol attribute. In BOM exports, they expand to the friendly name of
the attribute if the attribute is set (e.g. `Excluded from board` for
`${EXCLUDE_FROM_BOARD}` and `DNP` for `${DNP}`) or to an empty string if
the attribute is not set.

Finally, there are two special virtual fields that can be created:

- `${QUANTITY}` is a virtual field that contains the number of grouped
  instances of each symbol.

- `${ITEM_NUMBER}` is a virtual field that contains the row number of
  each symbol in the table.

#### Tricks to simplify filling fields

There are several special copy/paste methods in the spreadsheet for
pasting values into larger regions, including auto-incrementing pasted
cells. These features may be useful when pasting values that are shared
in several symbols.

These methods are illustrated below.

| 1\. Copy (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+C</span>) | 2\. Select target cells               | 3\. Paste (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+V</span>) |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ![1copy](images/copypaste11.png)                | ![1selection](images/copypaste12.png) | ![1paste](images/copypaste13.png)                |
| ![2copy](images/copypaste21.png)                | ![2selection](images/copypaste22.png) | ![2paste](images/copypaste23.png)                |
| ![3copy](images/copypaste31.png)                | ![3selection](images/copypaste32.png) | ![3paste](images/copypaste33.png)                |
| ![4copy](images/copypaste41.png)                | ![4selection](images/copypaste42.png) | ![4paste](images/copypaste43.png)                |
| ![5copy](images/copypaste51.png)                | ![5selection](images/copypaste52.png) | ![5paste](images/copypaste53.png)                |

<div class="note">

These techniques are also available in other dialogs with a grid control
element.

</div>

## Reference Designators and Symbol Annotation

Reference designators are unique identifiers for components in a design.
They are often printed on a PCB and in assembly diagrams, and allow you
to match symbols in a schematic to the corresponding components on a
board.

In KiCad, reference designators consist of a letter indicating the type
of component (`R` for resistor, `C` for capacitor, `U` for IC, etc.)
followed by a number. If the symbol has multiple units then the
reference designator will also have a trailing letter indicating the
unit. Symbols that don’t have a reference designator set have a `?`
character instead of the number. Reference designators must be unique.

Reference designators can be automatically set when symbols are added to
the schematic, and you can set or reset reference designators yourself
by manually editing an individual symbol’s reference designator field or
in bulk using the Annotation tool.

<div class="note">

The process of setting a symbol’s reference designator is called
**annotation**.

</div>

### Auto-annotation

When auto-annotation is enabled, symbols will be automatically annotated
when they are added to the schematic. You can enable auto-annotation by
checking the **Automatically annotate symbols** checkbox in the
**Schematic Editor** → **Annotation Options** pane in **Preferences**.
Auto-annotation can also be toggled using the ![auto-annotate
icon](images/icons/annotate_24.png) button in the left toolbar.

<figure>
<img src="images/auto_annotation_preferences.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="alt=" />
</figure>

When multiple symbols are added simultaneously, they are annotated
according to the **Order** setting, sorted by either X or Y position.

The **Numbering** option sets the starting number for new reference
designators. This can be the lowest available number, or a number based
on the sheet number.

For more information about annotation options, see the documentation for
the [Annotation tool](#annotation-tool).

### Annotation tool

The Annotation tool automatically assigns reference designators to
symbols in the schematic. To launch the Annotation tool, click the
![Annotate icon](images/icons/annotate_24.png) button in the top
toolbar.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/annotate-dialog.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="annotate dialog" />
</figure>

The tool provides several options to control how symbols are annotated.

**Scope:** Selects whether annotation is applied to the entire
schematic, to only the current sheet, or to only the selected symbols.
If the **Recurse into subsheets** option is selected, symbols in
subsheets of the selected scope will be reannotated; otherwise symbols
in subsheets will not be reannotated. For example, if **Recurse into
subsheets** and **Selection only** selected, symbols in any selected
subsheets will be reannotated.

**Options:** Selects whether annotation should apply to all symbols and
reset existing reference designators, or apply only to unannotated
symbols.

**Order:** Chooses the direction of numbering. If symbols are sorted by
X position, all symbols on the left side of a schematic sheet will be
lower numbered than symbols on the right side of the sheet. If symbols
are sorted by Y position, all symbols on the top of a sheet will be
lower numbered than symbols at the bottom of the sheet.

**Numbering:** Selects the starting point for numbering reference
designators. The lowest unused number above the starting point is picked
for each reference designator. The starting point can be an arbitrary
number (typically zero), or it can be the sheet number multiplied by 100
or 1000 so that each part’s reference designator corresponds to the
schematic page it is on.

The **Clear Annotation** button clears all reference designators in the
selected scope.

Annotation messages can be filtered with the checkboxes at the bottom or
saved to a report using the **Save…​** button.

## Electrical Connections

There are two primary ways to establish connections: wires and labels.
Wires make direct connections, while labels connect to other labels with
the same name. Both wires and labels are shown in the schematic below.

<figure>
<img src="images/wires_labels.png" style="width:90.0%"
alt="Wires labels" />
</figure>

Connections can also be made with buses and with implicit connections
via hidden power pins.

This section will also discuss two special types of symbols that can be
added with the "Power symbol" button on the right toolbar:

- **Power symbols**: symbols for connecting wires to a power or ground
  net.

- **PWR_FLAG**: a specific symbol for indicating that a net is powered
  when it is not connected to a power output pin (for example, a power
  net that is supplied by an off-board connector).

### Wires

Wires are used to directly establish electrical connections between two
points. To establish a connection, a segment of wire must be connected
by its end to another segment or to a pin. Only wire ends create
connections; if a wire crosses the middle of another wire, a connection
will not be made.

Unconnected wire ends have a small square that indicates the connection
point. The square disappears when a connection is made to the wire end.
Unconnected pins have a circle, which also disappears when a connection
is made.

<div class="note">

Wires connect with other wires or pins only if their ends coincide
exactly. Therefore it is important to keep symbol pins and wires aligned
to the grid. It is recommended to always use a 50 mil grid when placing
symbols and drawing wires because the KiCad standard symbol library and
all libraries that follow its style also use a 50 mil grid.

</div>

<div class="note">

Symbols, wires, and other elements that are not aligned to the grid can
be snapped back to the grid by selecting them, right clicking, and
selecting **Align Elements to Grid**.

</div>

#### Drawing and editing wires

To begin connecting elements with wire, use the Wire tool ![line tool
icon](images/icons/add_line_24.png) in the right toolbar (w). Wires can
also be automatically started by clicking on an unconnected symbol pin
or wire end.

You can restrict wires to 90 degree angles using the ![90 degree wire
icon](images/icons/lines90_24.png) button in the left toolbar, or to 45
degree angles with the ![45 degree wire
icon](images/icons/hv45mode_24.png) button. The ![free angle wire
icon](images/icons/lines_any_24.png) button allows you to place wires at
any angle. You can cycle through these modes using
<span class="keycombo">Shift+Space</span>, or select the desired mode in
**Preferences** → **Schematic Editor** → **Editing Options**. These
modes affect [graphic lines](#graphic-lines) in addition to wires.

[As in the PCB editor](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#track-posture), the / hotkey
switches wire posture.

Wires can be moved and edited using the Move (M) or Drag (G) tools. As
with symbols, the **Move** tool moves only the selected segment, without
maintaining existing connections to other segments. The **Drag** tool
maintains existing connections.

You can select connected wires using the **Select Connection** tool
(<span class="keycombo">Alt+4</span>). This tool selects all connected
wire segments until it reaches a junction, starting with the selected
segment or the segment under the cursor. Using the tool again expands
the existing selection to the next junction.

You can break a wire segment into two pieces by right-clicking a wire
and selecting **Slice**. The segment will be separated at the current
mouse position. You can also separate a wire segment from the adjacent
segments by right-clicking the segment and selecting **Break**.

Normally the line style of a wire follows the net’s [net class
settings](#schematic-setup-netclasses) (nets are in the `Default` net
class if no other net class is specified). However, the line style for
the selected wire segments can be overridden in the wire’s properties
dialog (E when a wire segment is selected). The wire’s width, color, and
line style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) can be set. Setting the width
to `0`, clearing the color, and using the `Default` line style uses the
default width, color, and style, respectively, from the net class
settings. If a wire junction is included in the selection, the junction
size can also be edited here.

<figure>
<img src="images/wire_properties.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="wire and bus properties dialog" />
</figure>

#### Wire Junctions

Wires that cross are not implicitly connected. It is necessary to join
them by explicitly adding a junction dot if a connection is desired
(![Add Junction icon](images/icons/add_junction_24.png) button in the
right toolbar). Junction dots will be automatically added to wires that
start or end on top of an existing wire.

Junction dots are used in the schematic figure above on the wires
connected to `P1` pins 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23.

Junction size automatically follows the schematic’s **Junction dot
size** setting in **Schematic Setup** → **General** → **Formatting**.
Color follows the [net class setting](#schematic-setup-netclasses). The
automatic size and color can be overridden in each junction dot’s
properties; a size of `0` is equivalent to the schematic default size,
and clearing the color uses the net class color.

<figure>
<img src="images/junction_properties.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="junction properties dialog" />
</figure>

### Labels

Labels are used to assign net names to wires and pins. Wires with the
same net name are considered to be connected, so labels can be used to
make connections without drawing direct wire connections.

A net can only have one name. If two different labels are placed on the
same net, an ERC violation will be generated. Only one of the net names
will be used in the netlist. The final net name is determined according
to the [rules described below](#net-name-assignment-rules).

There are three types of labels, each with a different connection scope.

- **Local labels**, also referred to simply as labels, only make
  connections within a sheet. Add a local label with the ![Local Label
  icon](images/icons/add_label_24.png) button in the right toolbar.

- **Global labels** make connections anywhere in a schematic, regardless
  of sheet. Add a global label with the ![Global Label
  icon](images/icons/add_glabel_24.png) button in the right toolbar.

- **Hierarchical labels** connect to hierarchical sheet pins and are
  used in [hierarchical schematics](#hierarchical-schematics) for
  connecting child sheets to their parent sheet. Add a hierarchical
  label with the ![Hierarchical Label
  icon](images/icons/add_hierarchical_label_24.png) button in the right
  toolbar.

<div class="note">

Labels that have the same name will connect, regardless of the label
type, if they are in the same sheet.

</div>

<div class="tip">

You can convert from one type of label to another type of label using
the [Change To](#change-to) tools.

</div>

#### Adding and editing labels

After using the appropriate button or hotkey to create a label, the
Label Properties dialog appears.

<figure>
<img src="images/global_label_properties.png"
alt="Global Label Properties dialog" />
</figure>

The **Label** field sets the label’s text, which determines the net that
the label assigns to its attached wire. You can choose a label name from
a list of nets that are already in the schematic by clicking the
dropdown menu next to the label name field.

Label text supports [markup](#text-markup) for overbars, subscripts,
etc., as well as [variable substitution](#text-variables). Use the
**Syntax help** link in the dialog for a summary.

When the **Multiple label input** option is enabled, the **Label** field
supports entering multiple labels, with one label on each line. In this
case, the dialog will create multiple independent labels in sequence,
one per line.

<div class="tip">

Multiple label input may be useful for copying labels from other
sources, such as a spreadsheet.

</div>

There are several options to control the label’s appearance. You can
change the [font](#font), size, and color of the text, and set bold and
italic emphasis. You can also set the orientation of the text relative
to the label’s connection point. Hierarchical and global labels have
several additional options: the **Auto** option automatically sets the
label orientation based on the connected schematic elements, and
**Shape** option controls the shape of the label outline (**Input**,
**Output**, **Bidirectional**, **Tri-state**, or **Passive**). The
outline shape is purely visual and has no electrical consequence.

<div class="note">

The default text size can be set for a schematic in [Schematic
Setup](#schematic-setup-formatting), and the default font can be set in
[Preferences](#preferences-schematic-display-options).

</div>

<div class="note">

Global labels have additional settings to control margins around the
label text in the [Schematic Setup dialog](#schematic-setup-formatting).

</div>

Labels can also have fields added to them. Two fields have special
meaning (`Net Class` and `Sheet References`, described below), but
arbitrary fields can also be added. Label fields behave like [symbol
fields](#editing-symbol-properties): you can show or hide their name and
value and adjust the alignment, orientation, position, size, font,
color, and emphasis.

<div class="note">

Formatting options for label fields can be shown or hidden by
right-clicking on the header row of the label field table and enabling
or disabling the desired columns. Not all columns are shown by default.

</div>

Like symbol fields, label fields can be edited individually by opening
the properties of a specific label field from the schematic (double
click the label field, or use E).

After accepting the label properties, the label is attached to the
cursor for placement. The connection point for a label is the small
square in the corner of the label. The square disappears when the label
is connected to a wire or the end of a pin. If multiple labels were
specified in the dialog, each label is attached to the cursor for
placement after the previous label is placed.

<figure>
<img src="images/unconnected_label.png" alt="Unconnected label" />
</figure>

The connection point’s position relative to the label text can be
changed by choosing a different label orientation in the label’s
properties, or by mirroring/rotating the label.

The Label Properties dialog can be accessed at any time by selecting a
label and using the E hotkey, double-clicking on the label, or with
**Properties…​** in the right-click context menu.

#### Assigning net classes with labels

In addition to assigning net names, labels can be used to assign net
classes. A label field named `Net Class` assigns the specified net class
to the net associated with the label. To make it easier to assign net
classes in this way, `Net Class` is the default name for new label
fields, and `Net Class` fields present a dropdown list of all the net
classes that have been specified in [Schematic
Setup](#schematic-netclasses) or [Board
Setup](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#board-setup-net-classes).

You can also type in a net class that isn’t explicitly listed in the
Schematic/Board Setup priority list. Such implicit net classes can’t be
assigned any design settings, like net class color or track width, but
they can still be used in DRC rule queries.

If multiple `Net Class` fields are added to a label, or multiple labels
with `Net Class` fields are applied to a net, all of the specified net
classes are assigned to the net.

For more information about assigning net classes, see the [net class
documentation](#schematic-netclasses).

#### Inter-sheet references

Global labels can display inter-sheet references, which are a list of
page numbers for other places in the schematic where the same global
label appears. Clicking an inter-sheet reference travels to the listed
page. If multiple references are listed, clicking the reference list
brings up a menu to select the desired page.

Inter-sheet references are globally controlled in the [Schematic
Setup](#schematic-setup-formatting) window’s Formatting page. References
can be enabled or disabled, and the displayed format for the list can be
adjusted, including with optional prefix or suffix characters.

The image below shows a global label with inter-sheet references to two
other schematic pages. A prefix and suffix of `[` and `]`, respectively,
were added in Schematic Setup.

<figure>
<img src="images/inter-sheet-refs.png"
alt="global label with inter-sheet references" />
</figure>

A `Sheet References` field with value `${INTERSHEET_REFS}` is
automatically added to global labels, and is used to control the
appearance of inter-sheet references for that label. The
`${INTERSHEET_REFS}` text variable gets expanded to the full list of
inter-sheet references for the global label, as configured in Schematic
Setup. Visibility of inter-sheet references is globally controlled in
Schematic Setup rather than with the `Sheet References` field visibility
control. The `Sheet References` field has no meaning for other types of
labels.

### Buses

Buses are a way to group related signals in the schematic in order to
simplify complicated designs. Buses can be drawn like wires using the
bus tool ![bus tool icon](images/icons/add_bus_24.png), and are named
using labels the same way signal wires are.

In the following schematic, many pins are connected to buses, which are
the thick blue lines in the center.

<figure>
<img src="images/sch_with_buses.png" style="width:90.0%"
alt="Example schematic with buses" />
</figure>

#### Bus members

There are two types of bus in KiCad 6.0 and later: vector buses and
group buses.

A **vector bus** is a collection of signals that start with a common
prefix and end with a number. Vector buses are named `<PREFIX>[M..N]`
where `PREFIX` is any valid signal name, `M` is the first suffix number,
and `N` is the last suffix number. For example, the bus `DATA[0..7]`
contains the signals `DATA0`, `DATA1`, and so on up to `DATA7`. It
doesn’t matter which order `M` and `N` are specified in, but both must
be non-negative.

A **group bus** is a collection of one or more signals and/or vector
buses. Group buses can be used to bundle together related signals even
when they have different names. Group buses use a special label syntax:

`<OPTIONAL_NAME>{SIGNAL1 SIGNAL2 SIGNAL3}`

The members of the group are listed inside curly braces (`{}`) separated
by space characters. An optional name for the group goes before the
opening curly brace. If the group bus is unnamed, the resulting nets on
the PCB will just be the signal names inside the group. If the group bus
has a name, the resulting nets will have the name as a prefix, with a
period (`.`) separating the prefix from the signal name.

For example, the bus `{SCL SDA}` has two signal members, and in the
netlist these signals will be `SCL` and `SDA`. The bus `USB1{DP DM}`
will generate nets called `USB1.DP` and `USB1.DM`. For designs with
larger buses that are repeated across several similar circuits, using
this technique can save time.

Group buses can also contain vector buses. For example, the bus
`MEMORY{A[7..0] D[7..0] OE WE}` contains both vector buses and plain
signals, and will result in nets such as `MEMORY.A7` and `MEMORY.OE` on
the PCB.

Bus wires can be drawn and connected in the same manner as signal wires,
including using junctions to create connections between crossing wires.
Like signals, buses cannot have more than one name — if two conflicting
labels are attached to the same bus, an ERC violation will be generated.

#### Connections between bus members

Pins connected between the same members of a bus must be connected by
labels. It is not possible to connect a pin directly to a bus; this type
of connection will be ignored by KiCad.

In the example above, connections are made by the labels placed on wires
connected to the pins. Bus entries (wire segments at 45 degrees) to
buses are graphical only, and are not necessary to form logical
connections.

In fact, using the repetition command (Insert), connections can be very
quickly made in the following way, if component pins are aligned in
increasing order (a common case in practice on components such as
memories, microprocessors…​):

- Place the first label (for example `PCA0`)

- Use the repetition command as much as needed to place members. KiCad
  will automatically create the next labels (`PCA1`, `PCA2`…​) vertically
  aligned, theoretically on the position of the other pins.

- Draw the wire under the first label. Then use the repetition command
  to place the other wires under the labels.

- If needed, place the bus entries by the same way (Place the first
  entry, then use the repetition command).

<div class="note">

In the **Schematic Editor** → **Editing Options** section of the
Preferences menu, you can set the repetition parameters:

- Horizontal pitch

- Vertical pitch

- Label increment (labels can be incremented or decremented by 1, 2, 3,
  etc.)

</div>

#### Bus unfolding

The unfold tool allows you to quickly break out signals from a bus. To
unfold a signal, right-click on a bus object (a bus wire, etc) and
choose **Unfold from Bus**. Alternatively, use the **Unfold Bus** hotkey
(default: C) when the cursor is over a bus object. The menu allows you
to select which bus member to unfold.

After selecting the bus member, the next click will place the bus member
label at the desired location. The tool automatically generates a bus
entry and wire leading up to the label location. After placing the
label, you can continue placing additional wire segments (for example,
to connect to a component pin) and complete the wire in any of the
normal ways.

#### Bus aliases

Bus aliases are shortcuts that allow you to work with large group buses
more efficiently. They allow you to define a group bus and give it a
short name that can then be used instead of the full group name across
the schematic.

To create bus aliases, open the **Bus Alias Definitions** pane in
[Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup).

<figure>
<img src="images/bus_alias_definitions.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Bus Alias Definitions" />
</figure>

An alias may be named any valid signal name. Using the dialog, you can
add signals or vector buses to the alias. As a shortcut, you can type or
paste in a list of signals and/or buses separated by spaces, and they
will all be added to the alias definition. In this example, we define an
alias called `USB` with members `DP`, `DM`, and `VBUS`.

After defining an alias, it can be used in a group bus label by putting
the alias name inside the curly braces of the group bus: `{USB}`. This
has the same effect as labeling the bus `{DP DM VBUS}`. You can also add
a prefix name to the group, such as `USB1{USB}`, which results in nets
such as `USB1.DP`. For complicated buses, using aliases can make the
labels on your schematic much shorter. Keep in mind that the aliases are
just a shortcut, and the name of the alias is not included in the
netlist.

Bus aliases are saved in the schematic file that is opened when the
alias is created. The **Bus Alias Definitions** window shows the
schematic file associated with the selected alias at the bottom of the
alias list. Any aliases created in a given schematic sheet are available
to use in any other schematic sheet that is in the same hierarchical
design. If multiple sheets in a hierarchical design contain
identically-named bus aliases, the aliases must all have the same
members. [ERC will report a violation](#list-of-erc-checks) if multiple
bus aliases with the same name do not have consistent members.

#### Buses with more than one label

KiCad 5.0 and earlier allowed the connection of bus wires with different
labels together, and would join the members of these buses during
netlisting. This behavior has been removed in KiCad 6.0 because it is
incompatible with group buses, and also leads to confusing netlists
because the name that a given signal will receive is not easily
predicted.

If you open a design that made use of this feature in a modern version
of KiCad, you will see the Migrate Buses dialog which guides you through
updating the schematic so that only one label exists on any given set of
bus wires.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/dialog_migrate_buses.png" style="width:90.0%"
alt="Bus Migration Dialog" />
</figure>

For each set of bus wires that has more than one label, you must choose
the label to keep. The drop-down name box lets you choose between the
labels that exist in the design, or you can choose a different name by
manually entering it into the new name field.

### Power Symbols

Power symbols are symbols that are conventionally used to represent a
connection to a power net, such as `VCC` or `GND`. Power symbols are
virtual: they do not represent a physical component on the PCB.

In addition to being a visual indicator that the attached net is a power
rail, power symbols make global connections: two power symbols with the
`Value` connect to each other anywhere in the schematic, regardless of
sheet. The power symbol’s `Value` field determines the name of the
attached net.

<div class="note">

In previous versions of KiCad, power symbols used invisible power input
pins, which make implicit global connections based on the pin name as
described [below](#hidden-power-pins). Beginning in KiCad 8, power
symbols do not need to use invisible pins, and the global connection is
made based on the power symbol’s value.

</div>

In the figure below, power symbols are used to connect the positive and
negative terminals of the capacitors to the `VCC` and `GND` nets,
respectively.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/power_ports_example.png" style="width:90.0%"
alt="Power symbols example" />
</figure>

In the KiCad standard library, power symbols are found in the `power`
library, but power symbols can be created in any library. Creating
custom power symbols is described in the [symbol editor
documentation](#creating-power-symbols). Instead of making a new symbol,
you can also modify an existing power symbol in the schematic: changing
its `Value` field will change the net the power symbol connects to.

### Net name assignment rules

Every net in the schematic is assigned a name, whether that name is
specified by the user or automatically generated by KiCad.

When multiple labels are attached to the same net, the final net name is
determined in the following order, from highest priority to lowest:

1.  Global labels

2.  [Power symbols](#power-symbols)

3.  Local labels

4.  Hierarchical labels

5.  Hierarchical sheet pins

    - Output is higher priority than Input

If there are multiple labels of one type attached to a net, the names
are sorted alphabetically and the first is used.

If a net travels through multiple sheets of a
[hierarchy](#hierarchical-schematics), it will take its name from the
highest level of the hierarchy where it has a hierarchical label or
local label. As usual, local labels take priority over hierarchical
labels.

If none of the label types above are attached to a net, the net’s name
is automatically generated based on the connected symbol pins.

### PWR_FLAG

Two `PWR_FLAG` symbols are visible in the screenshot above. They
indicate to ERC that the two power nets `VCC` and `GND` are actually
connected to a power source, as there is no explicit power source such
as a voltage regulator output attached to either net.

Without these two flags, the ERC tool would diagnose: *Error: Input
Power pin not driven by any Output Power pins.*

The `PWR_FLAG` symbol is found in the `power` symbol library. The same
effect can be achieved by connecting any power output pin to the net.

### No-connection flag

No-connection flags (![No-connection icon](images/icons/noconn_24.png))
are used to indicate that a pin is intentionally unconnected. These
flags prevent "unconnected pin" [ERC warnings](#erc) for pins that are
intentionally unconnected. Also, while symbol pins that are stacked on
top of each other are normally connected to the same net, if a
no-connection flag is added to the stacked pins they will instead be
connected to separate nets.

Note that no-connection flags are distinct from the ["unconnected"
symbol pin type](#pin-electrical-types), although they both prevent
"unconnected pin" ERC warnings on the pin in question and prevent
stacked pins from connecting to each other.

### Hidden Power Pins

When the power pins of a symbol are visible, they must be connected, as
with any other signal. However, symbols are sometimes drawn with hidden
power input pins, which are connected implicitly. KiCad automatically
connects invisible pins with type Power Input to a global net with the
same name as the pin. For example, if a symbol has a hidden power input
pin named `VCC`, this pin will be globally connected to the `VCC` net on
all sheets. This kind of implicit connection is not recommended in new
designs.

<div class="warning">

Care must be taken with hidden power input pins because they can create
unintentional connections. By nature, hidden pins are invisible and do
not display their pin name. This makes it easy to accidentally connect
two power pins to the same net. For this reason, **using invisible power
pins in symbols is not recommended** and is only supported for
compatibility with legacy designs and symbols.

</div>

<div class="note">

Hidden pins can be shown in the schematic by checking the **Show hidden
pins** option in the **Schematic Editor** → **Display Options** section
of the preferences, or by selecting **View** → **Show hidden pins**.
There is also a toggle icon ![hidden pin
24](images/icons/hidden_pin_24.png) on the left toolbar.

</div>

## Net classes

Net classes are named groupings of nets that can be assigned design
rules (for the PCB) and graphical properties (for the schematic).

More than one net class can be assigned to a net (through a combination
of graphical assignments and net class patterns). For nets with multiple
net classes assigned, an effective aggregate net class is formed, taking
any net class properties from the highest priority net class which has
that property set. Net class priority is determined by the ordering in
the Schematic or Board Setup dialogs. The `Default` net class is used as
a fallback for any missing properties after all explicit net classes
have been considered; this means that nets may be part of the `Default`
net class even if they have other net classes explicitly assigned.

Net classes may be created and edited in either the Schematic or Board
Setup dialogs. Nets can be added to net classes in either the schematic
or board using pattern-based assignments described below. Nets can also
be assigned to net classes in the schematic using graphical assignments
with net class directives or [net labels](#label-netclass).

Selecting a wire or label displays the net’s net class in the message
panel at the bottom of the window.

<figure>
<img src="images/resolved_netclass.png"
alt="selected wire’s net class displayed in status pane" />
</figure>

### Managing net classes in Schematic Setup

Net classes are managed in the **Net Classes** panel of the **Schematic
Setup** dialog.

<figure>
<img src="images/schematic_setup_netclasses.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Schematic Setup net classes panel" />
</figure>

The top pane lists the net classes that exist in the design. The
`Default` net class always exists, and you can add additional net
classes with the ![add net class icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png)
button or remove the selected net class with the ![delete net class
icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button.

Net classes can be moved up and down in priority order with the ![move
net class up icon](images/icons/small_up_16.png) and ![move net class
down icon](images/icons/small_down_16.png) buttons. Note that the
`Default` net class will always be the lowest priority net class and can
therefore not be moved.

Each net class can have unique graphic properties that determine how
wires of that net class are displayed in the schematic. Wire and bus
thicknesses, color, and line style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) can all
be adjusted. Setting the color to transparent will use the theme’s
default wire/bus color for the net class, which is configurable in
[Preferences](#preferences-colors). By default any color that is
configured for a net class controls the color is used to draw wires in
that net class. If the **Highlight netclass colors** setting is enabled
in the Display Options section of the Schematic Editor preferences, this
color will instead be used to draw a highlight around wires in that
netclass, and the wires themselves will always be drawn with the color
scheme’s wire color.

You can also set board design rules for each net class, although the DRC
fields are hidden by default. Right click the header row to show or hide
additional columns. For more information about setting net class design
rules, see the [PCB editor
documentation](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#board-setup-net-classes).

All net class parameters for user-defined net classes are optional.
However, all properties belonging to the `Default` net class must be
set. When a net has more than one net class assigned, the appropriate
value for graphic properties or board design rules is taken from the
highest priority assigned net class with the relevant value set. If only
one net class is assigned which contains missing properties, any missing
values will be taken from the `Default` net class.

The bottom pane lists pattern-based net class assignments. Each row has
a net name pattern and a net class; nets with names that match the
pattern are assigned to the specified net class. If a net matches
multiple patterns, the net is assigned to all of the matching net
classes. You can sort the list of net class assignment patterns by
pattern or by net class name by clicking on the corresponding column
header.

Pattern-based net class assignments are dynamic: when a new net is added
that matches an existing pattern, it will be assigned to the associated
net class automatically. Net patterns can use both wildcards (`*` to
match any number of any characters, including none, and `?` to match any
character) and [regular
expressions](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_resyntax.html). The
nets that match the selected pattern are displayed to the right of the
pattern list.

For example, the `net*` pattern matches nets named `net`, `net1`,
`network`, and any other net name beginning with `net`. Because `*` has
a slightly different meaning in a regular expression (`*` matches zero
or more of the preceding character), the `net*` pattern would also match
a net named `ne`.

<div class="note">

Remember that net names must include the full sheet path. For example, a
locally labeled net in the root sheet has a name prefixed with `/`.

</div>

Use the ![add net class icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) button to
add a net class assignment pattern or the ![delete net class
icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button to remove a pattern.

Instead of adding net class patterns in the Schematic Setup dialog, you
can directly create net class patterns from the schematic canvas. Right
click a net and select **Assign Netclass…​** to bring up the **Add
Netclass Assignment** dialog. The net class pattern is pre-filled with
the name of the selected net, but the pattern can be changed if desired.
All nets matching the pattern are displayed in the dialog. This method
can only be used on nets with an assigned name.

<figure>
<img src="images/schematic_assign_netclass.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="assigning a net class from the schematic" />
</figure>

### Graphically assigning net classes in the schematic

As an alternative to pattern-based net class assignment, net classes can
be graphically assigned to nets in the schematic using either
**directive labels**, **net labels**, or **rule areas**.

In the image below, a directive label is used to assign signals to the
`50R` net class.

<figure>
<img src="images/netclass_directive_bus.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="a net class directive attached to a bus" />
</figure>

Directive labels are added with the ![directive label
icon](images/icons/add_class_flag_24.png) button in the right toolbar.
They behave like [labels](#labels), except that they cannot be used to
name a net. The attached net is assigned a net class according to the
value of the directive’s `Net Class` field. The `Net Class` field
presents a dropdown list of all the net classes that have been specified
in [Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup-netclasses) or [Board
Setup](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#board-setup-net-classes).

You can also type in a net class that isn’t explicitly listed in the
Schematic/Board Setup priority list. Such implicit net classes can’t be
assigned any design settings, like net class color or track width, but
they can still be used in DRC rule queries.

If multiple `Net Class` fields are added to a directive label, or
multiple directive labels with `Net Class` fields are applied to a net,
all of the specified net classes are assigned to the net.

If a directive is attached to a bus, all members of the bus are assigned
to the specified net class.

<figure>
<img src="images/netclass_directive_properties.png" style="width:85.0%"
alt="net class directive window" />
</figure>

In addition to the associated net class, you can edit the directive’s
**shape** (dot, circle, diamond, or rectangle), **orientation**, **pin
length**, and **color** in the directive’s properties.

<div class="note">

[Net labels can also be used to assign net classes](#label-netclass) to
nets by adding a `Net Class` field to the label.

</div>

The Rule Area tool (![rule area
button](images/icons/add_keepout_area_24.png)) can be used to draw a
shape to which net class directives can be attached. Any [wire](#wires),
[bus](#buses), [label](#labels), or symbol pin which crosses or is
inside the rule area will be assigned the net class of a net class
directive attached to the rule area border. An example is shown in the
image below; all wires passing through the rule area will be assigned
the `RAM_ADDR` net class.

<figure>
<img src="images/netclass_rule_area.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="net class assignment by rule area" />
</figure>

You can show or hide directive labels in the schematic using the
**View** → **Show Directive Labels** option.

## Component classes

Component classes are named groupings of components: they are assigned
to symbols in the schematic and also apply to the corresponding
footprints on the board. They are used to group symbols into channels
for [multichannel designs](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#multichannel) and can
also be used to group footprints in [custom DRC
rules](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#custom-design-rules).

To assign a component class to a symbol, you can add a symbol field
named `Component Class` to the symbol. The symbol will then be a member
of the component class named by the field.

You can also assign component classes using directive labels
(![directive label button](images/icons/add_class_flag_24.png)) in
combination with rule areas (![rule area
button](images/icons/add_keepout_area_24.png)). The Rule Area tool can
be used to draw a shape to which directive labels can be attached. Any
symbol which crosses or is inside the rule area will be assigned to the
component class specified by the directive label attached to the rule
area border. An example is shown in the image below; R1 and R2 will be
assigned to the `Channel 1` component class.

<figure>
<img src="images/component_class_rule_area.png"
alt="component class rule area" />
</figure>

Components can have more than one class, and symbols take on a class if
any of their sub-units have that class. If multiple `Component Class`
fields are added to a directive label, or multiple directive labels with
`Component Class` fields are applied to a rule area, the symbols in the
rule area will take on all of the specified component classes.

## Graphics and text

Text, graphic shapes, and images can be added to schematics for
documentation purposes. These items do not have any electrical effect on
the schematic.

The image below shows graphic lines and text ("COMMUNICATION DSP") in
addition to symbols and several types of labels.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/frame_example.png" style="width:65.0%"
alt="Frame with comment example" />
</figure>

### Text and text boxes

Two kinds of text can be added to schematics, which are referred to as
text (![Add text icon](images/icons/text_24.png)) and text boxes (![Add
textbox icon](images/icons/add_textbox_24.png)). Both are added using
their respective buttons in the right toolbar. Text boxes are similar to
regular text except that they have an optional border and they
automatically reflow text within that border.

<figure>
<img src="images/text_and_textbox.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="schematic text and textbox example" />
</figure>

Both kinds of text item support multiline text and basic formatting
features, but text boxes wrap text to fit in the outline and have
additional formatting options. All text has adjustable fonts, color,
size, bold and italic emphasis, left and right alignment, and vertical
and horizontal orientation. Text boxes additionally support horizontal
centering, vertical alignment options, and colored borders and fill. You
can also adjust the padding on each side of text in a text box (padding
can be set using the [Properties Manager](#editing-object-properties),
but not using the Text Box Properties dialog).

<div class="note">

The default text size can be set for a schematic in [Schematic
Setup](#schematic-setup-formatting), and the default font can be set in
[Preferences](#preferences-schematic-display-options).

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/text_box_properties.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="text box properties dialog" />
</figure>

#### Links

Text and text boxes can be made into a link by entering a target in the
**Link** box in the text properties.

You can link to different kinds of resources depending on the link
target. The link target can be:

- a sheet in the current schematic, using `#` followed by the page
  number

- a local file on your machine, using a URL with the `file://` scheme

- a website, using a URL with the `http://` or `https://` scheme

- another resource, using a URL with the appropriate scheme, e.g.
  `ftp://`

If no protocol prefix is used, the target is assumed to be a local file
as if the `file://` scheme was used.

Sheet, file, and web links can be autofilled using the dropdown meu in
the link target box. Other kinds of links cannot be autofilled but will
work if your system can handle them.

#### Fonts

Text and text boxes support custom fonts, which are selectable with the
**Font** dropdown in the properties dialog for the text. In addition to
the KiCad font, you can use any TTF font installed on your computer.

<div class="note">

User fonts are not embedded in the project. If the project is opened on
another computer that does not have the selected font installed, a
different font will be substituted. For maximum compatibility, use the
KiCad font.

</div>

#### Text markup

Text supports markup for superscripts, subscripts, overbars, evaluating
project variables, and accessing symbol field values.

| Feature                                      | Markup Syntax        | Result                             |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Superscript                                  | `text^{superscript}` | text<sup>superscript</sup>         |
| Subscript                                    | `text_{subscript}`   | text<sub>subscript</sub>           |
| Overbar                                      | `~{text}`            | <span class="overline">text</span> |
| [Variables](#schematic-setup-text-variables) | `${variable}`        | *variable_value*                   |
| [Symbol Fields](#text-variables)             | `${refdes:field}`    | *field_value* of symbol *refdes*   |

<div class="note">

Variables must be defined in [Schematic
Setup](#schematic-setup-text-variables) before they can be used. There
are also a number of [built-in system text variables](#text-variables).

</div>

#### Simulation directives

Text and textboxes can contain [simulation directives](#sim-directives)
for SPICE simulations. The **Exclude from simulation** checkbox prevents
text from being interpreted as a simulation directive.

### Tables

You can use a table to organize text in a tabular format. Tables have
customizable borders, cell sizes, colors, and headers.

<figure>
<img src="images/table.png" alt="table" />
</figure>

To place a table, use the ![table 24](images/icons/table_24.png) button
in the right toolbar. Click in the canvas to place the top left corner
of the table, then click again to place the bottom right corner of the
table and finish drawing the table. The bigger you draw the table, the
more rows and columns will be added by default, but rows and columns can
be added or deleted after the table is created.

#### Editing table properties

When you finish drawing a table, the Table Properties dialog appears.
You can also open the Table Properties dialog in several other ways:

- Select any cell in the table, right click, and select **Edit Table**
  (Ctrl + E)

- Select the entire table, right click, and select **Properties…​** (E).
  You can select the entire table with a drag selection or by selecting
  a single cell, then right clicking and selecting **Select Table**.

- Click the **Edit Table…​** button in the Table Cell Properties dialog.

<figure>
<img src="images/table_properties.png" alt="table properties" />
</figure>

This dialog lets you edit the properties of the entire table, including
the text in each cell and the separators between cells. To change the
formatting of text in a cell, edit the properties of individual cells,
instead of the properties for the entire table.

<div class="note">

The properties for a table can also be edited in the [Properties
Manager](#editing-object-properties) when the entire table is selected.

</div>

The left side of the dialog displays an editable grid of the entire
table. You can edit the contents of any cell by clicking on the cell in
the grid. You can also edit the text in a cell by selecting the cell and
using the Properties Manager.

<div class="note">

Text in table cells supports the markup described in the [text markup
section](#text-markup) (superscripts, subscripts, strikethroughs, etc.).

</div>

The right side of the dialog contains formatting options for the table.

- The **Locked** checkbox controls whether or not the table is
  [locked](#locking). Locked objects may not be manipulated or moved,
  and cannot be selected unless the **Locked Items** option is enabled
  in the Selection Filter panel.

- The **External border** and **Header border** checkboxes control
  whether there is a border drawn around the entire table and the cells
  in the top row, respectively. When **Header border** is enabled, the
  border below the cells in the top row is styled using these external
  border settings rather than the row/column line settings. The line
  width of the header borders is controlled by the **Width** field. When
  set to 0, the line width uses the default symbol line width configured
  in the **Formatting** panel of Schematic Setup. The line color is
  controlled by the **Color** picker, and the line style can be set to
  solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot, or dash-dot-dot using the **Style**
  dropdown menu.

- The **Row Lines** and **Column lines** checkboxes enable horizontal
  lines between rows and vertical lines between columns, respectively.
  These have the same formatting options as the external and header
  borders.

#### Editing table cell properties

Instead of editing the properties of an entire table, you can also edit
the properties of individual cells. This modifies selected cells, but
does not affect other cells. To open the Table Cell Properties dialog,
double click on a cell, or select a cell, right click, and choose
**Properties…​** (E). If you select multiple cells, the properties dialog
will act on all of them at once.

<div class="note">

You can select multiple cells by clicking and dragging.

</div>

<div class="note">

To select all cells in a row or column, select a cell in that row or
column, right click, and choose **Select Row(s)** or **Select
Column(s)**. You can select multiple rows or columns in this way by
starting with multiple cells selected.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/table_cell_properties.png"
alt="table cell properties" />
</figure>

This dialog contains formatting options for the text in each cell.

- **Horizontal alignment** and **Vertical alignment** control how text
  is positioned within the cell.

- **Font** controls the text font used in the cell.

- **Text size** controls the size of the text in the cell.

- The **Bold** and **Italic** checkboxes bold and italicize the text,
  respectively. These are three-state checkboxes, which can be set to
  off, on, or no change. No change is useful when multiple cells with
  different bold/italic settings are being edited at the same time.

- The **Text color** and **Background fill** color pickers control the
  color of the text and the cell background, respectively.

- The **Cell margins** textboxes control the amount of spacing around
  the top, bottom, left, and right of the text in the cell.

You can click the **Edit Table…​** button to open the properties dialog
for the entire table.

<div class="note">

The properties for a table cell can also be edited in the [Properties
Manager](#editing-object-properties) when one or more table cells is
selected.

</div>

#### Editing table layout

The layout of a table (size and number of columns and rows) is initially
set when you create a table, but you can also edit the layout after
creation.

To resize a row or column, select a cell in that row or column, then
drag the handle on the right (to change the column width) or the bottom
(to change the row height) to the desired size.

To add rows or columns, select a cell next to where the new row or
column should go, right click, then choose **Add Row Above**, **Add Row
Below**, **Add Column Before**, or **Add Column After**, as desired.

To delete rows or columns, select a cell in the row or column you want
to delete, then right click and choose **Delete Row(s)** or **Delete
Column(s)**. To delete multiple rows or columns, start with a selection
that spans all the rows or columns you want to delete.

You can merge multiple cells into a single cell by selecting all the
cells you want to merge, right clicking, and choosing **Merge Cells**.
To unmerge them, select the merged cell, right click, and choose
**Unmerge Cells**.

### Graphic Shapes

Graphic rectangles (![Add rectangle
icon](images/icons/add_rectangle_24.png)), circles (![Add circle
icon](images/icons/add_circle_24.png)), arcs (![Add arc
icon](images/icons/add_arc_24.png)), and lines (![Add line
icon](images/icons/add_graphical_segments_24.png)) can all be added
using their respective buttons in the right toolbar.

<figure>
<img src="images/graphic_shapes.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Graphic rectangle, circle, arc, and lines in a schematic" />
</figure>

Line width, color, and style (solid, dashed, or dotted) can be
configured in the properties dialog for each shape (E). Rectangles,
circles, and arcs can also have a fill color set and have their outlines
removed.

<figure>
<img src="images/graphic_rectangle_properties.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="graphic rectangle properties dialog" />
</figure>

Setting a shape’s line width to 0 uses the schematic default line width,
which is configurable in [Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup-formatting).
Spacing for line dashes is also configurable there. Removing a line or
fill color uses the color theme’s graphics color, which is configurable
in [Preferences](#preferences-colors).

Like [wires](#drawing-and-editing-wires), graphic lines obey the line
drawing mode setting (90 degree, 45 degree, or free angle), which you
can set using the toggle buttons on the left toolbar (![90 degree wire
icon](images/icons/lines90_24.png), ![45 degree wire
icon](images/icons/hv45mode_24.png), and ![free angle wire
icon](images/icons/lines_any_24.png), respectively).
<span class="keycombo">Shift+Space</span> cycles through the modes.

[As with PCB tracks](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#track-posture), the / hotkey
switches line posture.

### Bitmap Images

KiCad supports inserting images into the schematic. These are purely for
reference during the design process and play no electrical role.

To add a reference image, use the ![image 24](images/icons/image_24.png)
button on the right toolbar and select the desired reference image file.
Click in the canvas to place the image.

Once the image has been added to the canvas, you can reposition it using
the move tool (M) or by dragging it in the canvas. You can scale it by
dragging the editing handles at the corners of the image. The image is
scaled around its reference point; in other words, the reference point
is the point in the image that always stays in the same position in the
canvas, no matter how the image is scaled. The reference point is shown
as a fifth editing handle. Initially it is at the center of the image,
but you can reposition the reference point by dragging it in the canvas.

<figure>
<img src="images/image_properties.png" alt="image properties" />
</figure>

You can also reposition or scale the image in its properties dialog (E).
You can set the image’s exact **Position X** and **Y** in the
**General** tab, and set an exact **Scale** factor in the **Image** tab.
You can also **Convert to Greyscale** if you wish. Position and scale in
this dialog are relative to the center of the image, not its interactive
reference point.

### Bulk editing text and graphics

Properties of text and graphics, including symbol fields, can be edited
in bulk using the **Edit Text and Graphic Properties** dialog (**Edit**
→ **Edit Text and Graphic Properties…​**). The tool can also modify
visual properties of wires and buses.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_edit_text_and_graphics_properties.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="eeschema edit text and graphics properties" />
</figure>

#### Scope and Filters

**Scope** settings restrict the tool to editing only certain types of
objects. If no scopes are selected, nothing will be edited.

**Filters** restrict the tool to editing particular objects in the
selected scope. Objects will only be modified if they match all enabled
and relevant filters (some filters do not apply to certain types of
objects. For example, symbol field filters do not apply to wires and are
ignored for the purpose of changing wire properties). If no filters are
enabled, all objects in the selected scope will be modified. For filters
with a text box, wildcards are supported: `*` matches any number of any
characters, including none, and `?` matches any single character.

**Filter fields by name** filters to the specified symbol, label, or
sheet field.

**Filter items by parent reference designator** filters to fields in the
symbol with the specified reference designator. **Filter items by parent
symbol library id** filters to fields in symbols with the specified
library identifier. **Filter items by parent symbol type** filters to
fields in symbols of the selected type (power or non-power).

**Filter items by net** filters to wires and labels on the specified
net.

**Only include selected items** filters to the current selection.

#### Editable Properties

Properties for filtered objects can be set to new values in the bottom
part of the dialog.

Drop-down lists and text boxes can be set to `-- leave unchanged --` to
preserve existing values. Checkboxes can be checked or unchecked to
enable or disable a change, but can also be toggled to a third "leave
unchanged" state. Color properties must be checked to change the value;
a checkerboard swatch indicates that the color will be inherited from
the default value from the the schematic settings or net class
properties.

Text properties that can be modified are **font**, **text size**, **text
orientation** (right/up/leftdown), **horizontal** and **vertical
alignment**, **text color**, emphasis (**bold** and **italic**), and
**visibility** of fields and field names.

Graphic and wire properties that can be modified are **line width**,
**line style** (solid, dashed, and dotted lines), **line color**, **fill
color** for shapes, and **junction size** and **junction color** for
wire junctions.

### Sheet title block

The drawing sheet’s title block is edited with the Page Settings tool
(![Page Settings tool](images/icons/sheetset_24.png)). You can also open
this tool by double clicking anywhere on any part of the drawing sheet.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/page_settings.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Page settings dialog" />
</figure>

Each field in the title block can be edited, as well as the paper size
and orientation. If the **Export to other sheets** option is checked for
a field, that field will be updated in the title block of all sheets,
rather than only the current sheet.

You can set the date to today’s or any other date by pressing the left
arrow button next to **Issue Date**. Note that the date listed in the
schematic title block is not automatically updated. It is only updated
when changed in this dialog.

A drawing sheet file can also be selected to replace the default drawing
sheet. When choosing a drawing sheet, you can enable the **Embed File**
checkbox in the file browser to embed the drawing sheet in the schematic
instead of referencing an external file. This means the schematic will
appear the same when it is opened on another computer that does not have
the drawing sheet file available at the same external file path. For
more information, see the [embedded files
documentation](#sch-embedding-files).

<figure>
<img src="images/en/title_block.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Title block" />
</figure>

The sheet number (Sheet X/Y) is automatically updated, but sheet page
numbers can also be manually set using **Edit** → **Edit Sheet Page
Number…​**.

## Schematic editing convenience functions

There are several convenience features in the Schematic Editor that make
some common editing and connection operations faster.

### Pin helpers

You can quickly add wires, labels, or no-connection markers to a
selection of pins using the **Pin Helpers** tools in the right-click
context menu. This can help you quickly break out unconnected pins from
a symbol or hierarchical sheet. By selecting **Pin Helpers** → **Wire**,
the wire tool will begin drawing a wire from all selected pins at once.
If you select **No Connect**, no-connection markers will be added to the
end of each selected pin. And if you choose **Net Label**,
**Hierarchical Label**, or **Global Label**, a label of the respective
type will be placed at the end of each selected pin. Each label’s name
will be set to the corresponding pin name. The new labels will remain
selected, so you can easily move them away from the symbol using M or G,
depending on whether you wish to maintain a wired connection between the
pins and the labels.

<div class="note">

Pin helpers require you to select individual pins, not their parent
symbol or sheet. Symbol pins cannot be individually selected if the
**clicking on a pin selects the symbol** option is enabled in the
Editing Options pane of the Schematic Editor preferences. Therefore,
this option must be disabled to use the Pin Helper tools.

</div>

![pin helpers global labels](images/pin_helpers_global_labels.png)

### Converting between object types

Existing labels and text objects can be changed to another type of label
or text by right clicking the object(s) and selecting the target object
type from the **Change To** submenu. The allowed types for source and
target objects are local labels, global labels, hierarchical labels,
directive labels, text objects, and text boxes. The value of the
original object is preserved in the resulting object: when a text object
is converted to a label, the label’s value (net name) will be the
original text, and vice versa.

### Swapping objects

You can swap the position of two selected objects using the Swap command
(<span class="keycombo">Alt+S</span>; also available in the right-click
context menu). This works on many schematic items, including symbols,
symbol fields, labels, graphical items, and text. The first object is
assigned the location and rotation of the second object, and vice versa.
If there are more than two objects selected, the locations are cycled:
the last object gets the position of the first object, the first object
gets the location of the second, and so on.

<div class="tip">

One possible use of the swap command is to exchange two units within a a
symbol, for example the two amplifiers in a dual op-amp. You could also
use swap with a selection of labels to quickly modify net assignments to
symbol pins. In combination with cross-selection from the PCB, this can
be a convenient way to make schematic changes for easier routing. This
is sometimes known as pin or gate swapping.

</div>

## Schematic Setup

The Schematic Setup window is used to set schematic options that are
specific to the currently active schematic. For example, the Schematic
Setup window contains formatting options, electrical rule configuration,
net class setup, and schematic text variable setup.

### Schematic formatting

<figure>
<img src="images/schematic_setup_formatting.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Schematic setup formatting" />
</figure>

The formatting panel contains settings for the appearance of symbols,
text, labels, graphics, and wires.

**Symbol unit notation** sets how each unit of a multi-unit symbol is
referred to in its reference designator. By default, a different letter
for each unit is appended to the reference designator with no separator,
for example `U1B` for the second unit of symbol `U1`, but this can be
changed. Numbers can be used instead of letters, and various separators
can be used between the symbol designator and the unit identifier (`.`,
`-`, `_`, or none).

**Default text size** sets the default text height used by the text,
text box, and label tools. **Overbar offset ratio** controls the
vertical spacing between text and an overbar (`~{}`) over that text, as
a ratio of the text height. **Label offset ratio** controls the vertical
spacing between a local label’s text and the attached wire, relative to
the label’s text size. This also affects the spacing between symbol pins
and their pin number. **Global label margin ratio** defines the size of
the box around a global label, relative to the global label’s text size.
Increasing the margin may be useful to avoid overlapping text with
overbars (`~{}`) or letters with descenders, but this may cause closely
packed global labels to overlap with each other.

**Default line width** sets the default line width for symbol graphics,
if the symbol does not override the default line width. **Pin symbol
size** scales symbol pin graphic style annotations, such as the bubble
on an inverted pin.

**Junction dot size** sets the schematic’s default wire junction dot
size. The default size can be overridden by editing an individual
junction dot’s properties. **Connection width** specifies the grid size
used for the **Symbol pin or wire end off connection grid** ERC check.
Schematics typically use a 50 mil grid for electrical connections, so
this should usually remain set at 50 mils.

The Operating Point Overlay settings configure how [operating point
simulation annotations](#sim-operating-point-annotations) are displayed
on the schematic canvas. The **significant digits** settings control the
number of significant digits printed on voltage and current overlays.
The **range** settings control the units used to display voltage and
current measurements.

**Show inter-sheet references** enables or disables the display of
[inter-sheet references](#intersheet-references), which are a list of
page numbers next to a global labels that link to other places in the
schematic where the same global label appears. **Show own page
reference** controls whether the current page is included in the list of
page numbers. **Standard** and **abbreviated** determine whether to
display the complete list of page numbers or only the first and last
page numbers. The **prefix** and **suffix** fields add optional
characters before and after the list of page numbers. In the image of an
inter-sheet reference below, a prefix and suffix of `[` and `]`,
respectively, have been added.

<figure>
<img src="images/inter-sheet-refs.png"
alt="global label with inter-sheet references" />
</figure>

Dashed line appearance is controlled in the Formatting section. **Dash
length** controls the length of dashes, while **Gap length** controls
the spacing between dashes and dots. The dash and gap lengths are
relative to the line width: a gap length of `2` means twice the width of
the line.

### Field name templates

<figure>
<img src="images/schematic_setup_field_name_templates.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="Schematic setup field name templates" />
</figure>

Field name templates are empty symbol fields that are automatically
added to all symbols in the schematic. These can be useful when every
symbol in the schematic needs additional fields beyond the fields that
are defined in the library symbols, for example a field for the
manufacturer’s part number.

Template fields can be set as visible or invisible, and can also be set
as URL fields.

Field name templates that are defined in schematic setup apply only to
the current project. Field name templates can also be defined in
[Preferences](#preferences-field-name-templates), which apply to all
projects edited on your computer.

### BOM presets

<figure>
<img src="images/schematic_setup_bom_presets.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Schematic Setup BOM presets panel" />
</figure>

BOM presets are saved configurations for the [Symbol Fields
Table](#symbol-fields-table) and [BOM export tool](#bom-export). There
are two types of presets. **BOM presets** configure which fields are
displayed in the symbol fields table, which order they are displayed in,
and how they are used to group symbols. These fields are also directly
used in the BOM output. **BOM formatting presets** configure the output
BOM file format, including which separator characters are used to
separate fields. Both types of presets are created in the Symbol Fields
Table, but can are listed and can be deleted here.

### ERC violation severity and pin conflicts map

The **Violation Severity** panel lets you configure what types of ERC
messages should be reported as Errors, Warnings, or ignored.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_erc_severity.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Schematic ERC severity settings" />
</figure>

The **Pin Conflicts Map** allows you to configure connectivity rules to
define electrical conditions for errors and warnings based on what types
of pins are connected to each other. For example, by default an error is
produced when an output pin is connected to another output pin.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_erc_options.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Schematic ERC Pin Conflicts Map" />
</figure>

These panels are explained in more detail in the [ERC
section](#erc-configuration).

### Net classes

<figure>
<img src="images/schematic_setup_netclasses.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Schematic Setup net classes panel" />
</figure>

The **Net Classes** panel allows you to manage net classes for the
project and assign nets to net classes with patterns. Managing net
classes in this panel is equivalent to managing them in the [Board Setup
dialog](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#board-setup-net-classes). Nets can also be
assigned to net classes in the schematic using graphical assignments
with [net class directives](#netclass-directive) or [net
labels](#label-netclass).

Pattern-based net class assigment is explained in more detail in the
[net classes section](#schematic-setup-netclasses).

### Bus alias definitions

<figure>
<img src="images/bus_alias_definitions.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Bus Alias Definitions" />
</figure>

The **Bus Alias Definitions** panel allows you to create bus aliases,
which are names for groups of signals in a bus. For more information
about bus aliases, see the [bus alias documentation](#bus-aliases).

### Text variables

<figure>
<img src="images/schematic_setup_text_variables.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Schematic setup text variables" />
</figure>

Text replacement variables can be created in the Text Variables section.
These variables allow you to substitute the variable name for any text
string. This substitution happens anywhere the variable name is used
inside the variable replacement syntax of `${VARIABLENAME}`.

For example, you could create a variable named `VERSION` and set the
text substitution to `1.0`. Now, in any text object on the PCB, you can
enter `${VERSION}` and KiCad will substitute `1.0`. If you change the
substitution to `2.0`, every text object that includes `${VERSION}` will
be updated automatically. You can also mix regular text and variables.
For example, you can create a text object with the text
`Version: ${VERSION}` which will be substituted as `Version: 1.0`.

Text variables can also be created in [Board
Setup](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#board-setup-text-variables). Text variables
are project-wide; variables created in the schematic editor are also
available in the board editor, and vice versa.

There are also a number of [built-in system text
variables](#text-variables).

### Embedding files

External files can be embedded within a schematic. Embedding a file
stores a copy of the file inside the schematic file. The design can then
refer to the embedded copy of the file instead of the external file,
which makes the project more portable as it doesn’t rely on an external
file. Fonts, datasheets, drawing sheets, SPICE models, and footprint 3D
models can be embedded and used within KiCad. Other arbitrary files can
also be embedded to store them in the project for later export, but they
are not used by any KiCad functionality. Files embedded in a schematic
necessarily increase the schematic’s file size, although files are
compressed before being embedded to minimize the space required.

<figure>
<img src="images/embedded_files.png" alt="embedded files" />
</figure>

Embedded files are managed in the Embedded Files section of Schematic
Setup. All files embedded in a schematic are shown here. To embed a file
inside a schematic, click the ![small folder
16](images/icons/small_folder_16.png) button and select the file. The
file is then embedded inside the schematic and is listed in the embedded
files list along with its *embedded reference*. The embedded reference
is a unique identifier for the embedded file that begins with
`kicad-embed://`. You can use the embedded reference elsewhere in the
Schematic Editor to refer to the embedded file as if it were an external
file path. You can copy the embedded reference by right clicking and
selecting **Copy Embedded Reference**. To remove an embedded file, click
the ![small trash 16](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button. Any
remaining links to the removed file will become invalid.

<div class="note">

Datasheets, SPICE models, and drawing sheets can be embedded directly
using the file browser when you add them to a symbol
([datasheets](#editing-symbol-properties) and [SPICE
models](#sim-library)) or to a schematic ([drawing
sheets](#sheet-title-block)) by enabling the **Embed Files** option in
the file browser. This is a single-step shortcut for adding the files in
Schematic Setup and then referring to them by their embedded reference;
the result is the same.

</div>

To embed any fonts used in a schematic, check the **Embed fonts**
checkbox. All fonts used in the schematic will be embedded, so text
using that font can be edited on any computer regardless of whether the
font file is installed.

You can also [embed files in a library symbol](#sym-embedding-files).
Such files will be available within the symbol, but not within the
larger schematic or in other symbols. Files embedded in a symbol are
deduplicated when the symbol is added to a schematic: if a file is
embedded in a symbol, and multiple instances of that symbol are added to
the schematic, only one copy of the file will be embedded, and all of
the symbol instances will refer to the same embedded file.

As an example, to embed a datasheet in a project and use it within
several symbols, you could embed the datasheet using the schematic setup
dialog, copy the internal reference, and paste the internal reference
into the datasheet field of each symbol that uses that datasheet. Each
symbol would then have a portable reference to the embedded datasheet.
Alternatively, you could embed the datasheet within the library symbol.
In this case, each symbol will already have the datasheet embedded when
the symbol is added to a schematic. A more convenient way to achieve the
same thing, however, is to open the symbol’s properties dialog, browse
for a datasheet file, and enable the **Embed File** option in the file
browser. Again, this could be done for a symbol in the schematic or for
a symbol in the source symbol library.

Files can also be embedded in
[boards](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#pcb-embedding-files).

### Importing settings

You can import some or all of the schematic setup from an existing
schematic. This allows you to choose a schematic to use as a template
and select which settings to import.

<figure>
<img src="images/import_settings.png" alt="import settings" />
</figure>

To import settings, click the **Import Settings from Another Project…​**
button at the bottom of the Schematic Setup dialog and then choose the
`.kicad_sch` file you want to import from. Select which settings you
want to import and the current settings will be overwritten with the
values from the chosen schematic.

The settings that are available to import are:

- Formatting preferences

- Field name templates

- BOM presets

- BOM format presets

- Violation severities

- Pin conflict map

- Net classes

- Bus alias definitions

- Text variables

## Opening legacy schematics

Modern versions of KiCad can always open projects created in older
versions of KiCad. However, schematics created in some older versions of
KiCad have special considerations that must be observed when opening
them in order to prevent any data loss.

### Opening KiCad 5.0 and 5.1 schematics

Modern versions of KiCad can open schematics created in versions prior
to KiCad 6.0, but the cache library file (`<projectname>-cache.lib`)
must be present to load the schematic correctly.

Since version 6.0, KiCad stores all symbols used in a project in the
schematic. This means that you can open a schematic made in KiCad 6.0 or
later on any computer, even if the libraries used in the project are not
installed or have changed. Modern KiCad schematic files use the
`.kicad_sch` extension.

Prior to version 6.0, KiCad did not store symbols in the schematic.
Instead, KiCad stored references to the symbols and their libraries. It
also stored a copy of every symbol used by the project in a separate
cache library file (`<projectname>-cache.lib`). As long as the cache
library was included with the project, the project could be distributed
without the system library files, because KiCad could load any needed
symbols from the cache library as a fallback if the libraries referenced
in the schematic were missing. Legacy KiCad schematic files use the
`.sch` extension.

When you open a legacy schematic, KiCad will look in the cache library
to find all of the symbols used in the schematic in the cache library.
When you save the legacy schematic, KiCad will save it as a new file in
the modern schematic format (`.kicad_sch`), with the necessary symbols
embedded in the schematic itself. The original legacy schematic and the
cache library will remain, unmodified, but they are no longer necessary
once the schematic has been saved in the modern format.

<div class="note">

Projects created in KiCad prior to version 6.0 must have a cache
library. If the cache library is missing, the schematic will lose symbol
information if the system symbol libraries are modified, reorganized,
moved, or deleted. The libraries included with legacy versions of KiCad
are substantially different than the modern KiCad libraries, so in
practice KiCad will almost always fail to open legacy projects unless
the cache library is present.

</div>

When you open a legacy schematic, KiCad may display the **Project Rescue
Helper** dialog. This means that one or more symbols in the cache
library do not match the corresponding symbol in the external library.
The dialog helps you "rescue" symbols from the cache library into your
schematic, if desired. You can also open the rescue dialog at any time
using **Tools** → **Rescue Symbols…​**. The cache library file must be
present in order to use the rescue tool.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_rescue_conflicts.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Rescue conflicts dialog" />
</figure>

The rescue dialog lists all symbols that don’t match between the cache
library and the external symbol library. The discrepancy can be because:

- the cached symbol or the library symbol has been modified, so the two
  symbols no longer match, or

- the cached symbol does not have a corresponding symbol in the symbol
  library, because the symbol or library was moved, renamed, deleted, or
  is not present on the current computer.

For each symbol in the list, selecting the symbol displays the reference
designator and value for each instance of the symbol, and shows a visual
preview of the symbol. If a corresponding symbol exists in the system
symbol library, the dialog shows both copies of the symbol for
comparison. If the symbol only exists in the cache library, the dialog
only shows the cached symbol.

In this example, the project originally used a diode with the cathode
facing left, but the library now contains one with the cathode facing
right. This change would break the design, so it would be important to
use the cached symbol as the original designer intended.

Pressing **Rescue Symbols** here will cause the selected symbols from
the cache library to be saved into a special `rescue` library
(`<projectname>-rescue.kicad_sym`). The corresponding symbols in the
schematic will be updated to use the newly rescued symbols. Any
unselected symbols will not be rescued, but their symbol linkage can be
updated in the schematic later.

Alternatively, pressing **Skip Symbol Rescue** will exit the dialog
without rescuing any symbols. KiCad will use the versions of the symbols
found in the external libraries. You can run the rescue function again
with **Tools** → **Rescue Symbols…​**, or manually edit symbol linkage in
the symbol’s properties.

If you would prefer not to see this dialog, you can press **Never Show
Again**. This has the same effect as pressing **Skip Symbol Rescue** for
the current schematic and all future schematics.

If a symbol in a legacy schematic cannot be found in either the cache
library or the external library, KiCad cannot rescue that symbol. A
placeholder symbol is inserted into the schematic in its place, as shown
below.

You can attempt to remap these orphaned symbols using the **Change
Symbols** or **Edit Symbol Library Links** dialogs, but either option
may require manual corrections to the schematic. These tools are
explained in more detail in the [Updating and exchanging
symbols](#updating-and-exchanging-symbols) section.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_missing_symbol.png"
alt="Missing symbol in an incompletely rescued schematic" />
</figure>

### Opening pre-5.0 schematics

Modern versions of KiCad can open schematics created in versions prior
to KiCad 5.0, but you will need to go through a symbol remapping process
to open the schematic without losing symbol information.

Since version 5.0, KiCad schematics refer to specific symbols using both
the symbol and library name. Even if multiple libraries each contain a
symbol with the same name, the designer’s intended symbol is
unambiguously specified.

Prior to version 5.0, KiCad schematics stored only the symbol name, not
the library name. Symbols in the schematic were indirectly mapped back
to the original library by searching through the project’s library list
for a matching symbol. When you open a pre-5.0 schematic, KiCad will
attempt to automatically "remap" the symbols so that each bare symbol
name is replaced with a fully-specified symbol library and symbol name
pair. The original schematics will be backed up in a `rescue-backup`
folder.

You can skip the automatic remapping, but you will need to remap the
symbols yourself using the [Change Symbols
dialog](#updating-and-exchanging-symbols). You can also re-run the Remap
Symbols tool using **Tools** → **Remap Legacy Library Symbols…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_remap_symbols.png"
alt="Remap symbols dialog" />
</figure>

# Hierarchical schematics

## Introduction

In KiCad, multi-sheet schematics are hierarchical: there is a single
root sheet, and additional sheets are created as subsheets of either the
root sheet or another subsheet. Sheets can be included in a hierarchy
multiple times, if desired.

Carefully drawing a schematic as a hierarchical design improves
schematic legibility and reduces repetitive drawing.

Creating a hierarchical schematic starts from the root sheet. The
process is to create a subsheet, then draw the circuit in the subsheet
and make the necessary electrical connections between sheets.
Connections can be made between nets in a subsheet and nets in the
parent sheet using hierarchical pins and labels, or between any two nets
in the hierarchy using global labels.

## Adding sheets to a design

You can add a subsheet to a design with the Add Hierarchical Sheet tool
(S hotkey, or the ![Add Hierarchical Sheet
icon](images/icons/add_hierarchical_subsheet_24.png) button in the right
toolbar). Launch the tool, then click twice in the canvas to draw the
upper left and lower right corners of the subsheet symbol. Make the
sheet outline large enough to fit the [hierarchical pins you will add
later](#hierarchical-sheet-pins).

<figure>
<img src="images/draw_hierarchical_sheet.png"
alt="Drawing a hierarchical sheet" />
</figure>

The Sheet Properties dialog will appear and prompt you for a sheet name
and filename.

<figure>
<img src="images/hierarchical_sheet_properties.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Hierarchical sheet properties" />
</figure>

The **sheet name** must be unique, as it is used in the full net name
for any nets in the subsheet. For example, a net with the local label
`net1` in the sheet `sheet1` would have a full net name of
`/sheet1/net1`. The sheet name is also used to refer to the sheet in
various places in the GUI, including the [title
block](#sheet-title-block) and the [hierarchy
navigator](#navigating-between-sheets). The sheet name can also be
changed in the hierarchy navigator.

The **sheet file** specifies the file that the new sheet will be saved
to or loaded from. The path to the sheet file can be relative or
absolute. It is usually preferable to save subsheet files in the project
directory and use a relative path so that the project is portable.

A single sheet file can be used more than once in a project by
specifying the same filename for each repeated sheet; the circuit drawn
in the sheet will be instantiated once per usage, and any edits in once
instance will be reflected in the other instances.

<div class="note">

Sheet files can be shared between multiple projects to allow design
reuse between projects. However, this is not recommended due to path
portability concerns and the risk of unintentionally changing other
projects while editing a shared sheet.

</div>

The sheet’s **page number** is configurable here. The page number is
displayed in the sheet [title block](#sheet-title-block) and the
[hierarchy navigator](#navigating-between-sheets), and sheets are sorted
by page number in the hierarchy navigator and when [printing or
plotting](#generating-outputs). The sheet number can also be changed in
the hierarchy navigator or for the current page with **Edit** → **Edit
Sheet Page Number…​**.

Other attributes for sheets are **Exclude from simulation**, **Exclude
from bill of materials**, **Exclude from board**, and **Do not
populate**. When any of these attributes are set for a sheet, they are
inherited by all symbols in that sheet, [as if they were set on the
symbols themselves](#editing-symbol-properties).

Several graphical options are also available. **Border width** sets the
width of the border around the sheet shape. **Border color** and
**Background fill** set the color for the border and fill of the sheet
shape, respectively. If no color is set, a checkerboard swatch is shown
and the default values from the color theme are used.

Sheets support arbitrary custom fields, which can be added and removed
with the ![plus icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) and ![trash
icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) buttons, respectively. Sheet
fields can be optionally displayed on the schematic by checking their
**Show** box, and they can be accessed from inside the sheet or in other
sheet fields using [text variables](#text-variables).

The Sheet Properties dialog can be accessed at any time by selecting a
sheet symbol and using the E hotkey, or by right-clicking on a sheet
symbol and selecting **Properties…​**.

## Navigating between sheets

You can enter a hierarchical sheet from the parent sheet by
double-clicking the child sheet’s shape, or right-clicking the child
sheet and selecting **Enter Sheet**.

Return to the parent sheet by using the ![up arrow
icon](images/icons/up_24.png) button in the top toolbar, or by
right-clicking in an empty part of the schematic and clicking **Leave
Sheet**.

You can jump to the next sheet with the ![right arrow
icon](images/icons/right_24.png) button, or to the previous sheet with
the ![left arrow icon](images/icons/left_24.png) button.

Alternatively, you can jump to any sheet with the hierarchy navigator.
To open the hierarchy navigator, click the ![Hierarchy navigator
icon](images/icons/hierarchy_nav_24.png) button in the left toolbar. The
hierarchy navigator docks at the left of the screen. Each sheet in the
design is displayed as an item in the tree. Clicking a sheet name opens
that sheet in the editing canvas. You can also use the hierarchy
navigator to rename or renumber a sheet by right clicking on the sheet
name and selecting **Edit page number** or **Rename**.

<figure>
<img src="images/hierarchy_navigator_pane.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="hierarchy navigator" />
</figure>

## Electrical connections between sheets

### Label overview

Electrical connections between sheets are made with [labels](#labels).
There are several kinds of labels in KiCad, each with a different
connection scope.

- **Local labels** only make connections within a sheet. Therefore local
  labels cannot be used to connect between sheets. Local labels are
  added with the ![Local Label icon](images/icons/add_label_24.png)
  button.

- **Global labels** make connections anywhere in a schematic, regardless
  of sheet. Global labels are added with the ![Global Label
  icon](images/icons/add_glabel_24.png) button.

- **Hierarchical labels** connect to **hierarchical sheet pins**
  accessible in the parent sheet. Hierarchical designs rely on
  hierarchical labels and pins to make connections between parent sheets
  and child sheets. You can think of sheet pins as defining the
  interface for a sheet; hierarchical labels within the child sheet
  connect to corresponding sheet pins which are visible in the parent
  sheet. Hierarchical labels are added inside a child sheet using the
  ![Hierarchical Label icon](images/icons/add_hierarchical_label_24.png)
  button.

<div class="note">

Labels that have the same name will connect, regardless of the label
type, if they are in the same sheet.

</div>

<div class="note">

[Hidden power pins](#hidden-power-pins) can also be considered global
labels, because they connect anywhere in the schematic hierarchy.

</div>

### Hierarchical sheet pins

After placing hierarchical labels within the subsheet, matching
**hierarchical sheet pins** can be added to the subsheet symbol in the
parent sheet. You can then make connections to the hierarchical pins
with wires, labels, and buses. Hierarchical sheet pins in a subsheet
symbol are connected to the matching hierarchical labels in the subsheet
itself.

<div class="note">

Hierarchical labels must be defined in the subsheet before the
corresponding hierarchical sheet pin can be imported in the sheet
symbol.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/hierarchical_sheet_pins.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="hierarchical sheet symbol with pins" />
</figure>

For every hierarchical label in the subsheet, add the corresponding
hierarchical pin onto the sheet symbol by clicking the ![Place Sheet
Pins icon](images/icons/add_hierar_pin_24.png) button in the right
toolbar, then clicking on the sheet symbol. A sheet pin for the first
unmatched hierarchical label will be attached to the cursor, where it
can be placed anywhere along the border of the sheet symbol. Clicking
again with the tool will continue to add additional sheet pins until all
of the hierarchical labels in the subsheet have a matching sheet pin on
the sheet symbol. Sheet pins can also be imported by selecting **Place
Sheet Pin** in a sheet symbol’s right-click context menu.

You can edit the properties of a sheet pin in the Sheet Pin Properties
dialog. Open this dialog by double-clicking a sheet pin, selecting a
sheet pin and using the E hotkey, or right-clicking a sheet pin and
selecting **Properties…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/sheet_pin_properties.png"
alt="Sheet Pin Properties dialog" />
</figure>

The sheet pin’s **name** can be edited in the textbox or by selecting
from the dropdown list of hierarchical labels in the subsheet. A sheet
pin’s name has to match the corresponding hierarchical label in the
subsheet, so if you change a pin name you must change the label name as
well.

**Shape** changes the shape of the sheet pin, and has no electrical
effect. It can be set to Input, Output, Bidirectional, Tri-state, or
Passive. The pin’s **font**, **text size**, **color**, and emphasis
(bold or italic) can also be changed.

### Syncing sheet pins

Another way to manage the connections between hierarchical labels and
sheet pins is to use the Sync Sheet Pins tool. Launch this tool using
the ![Sync Sheet Pins
icon](images/icons/import_hierarchical_label_24.png) button in the right
toolbar or with **Sync Sheet Pins** in a sheet symbol’s right click
context menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/sync_sheet_pins.png" alt="sync sheet pins" />
</figure>

This dialog shows the hierarchical labels and hierarchical sheet pins
for each hierarchical sheet. If the tool was launched from the context
menu of a sheet symbol, only one tab will be available, with the labels
and sheet pins for that specific sheet. If the tool was started
globally, i.e. with the ![import hierarchical label
24](images/icons/import_hierarchical_label_24.png) button or with
**Place** → **Sync Sheet Pins**, a tab will be shown for each
hierarchical sheet.

The icon in each tab indicates whether the hierarchical sheet pins on
the sheet symbol are correctly matched with the hierarchical labels
inside the sheet. If the tab has a ![ercwarn
16](images/icons/ercwarn_16.png) icon, then there is a hierarchical
label in the sheet without a matching sheet pin, or a sheet pin without
a corresponding hierarchical label, or both. If the tab has a ![erc
green 16](images/icons/erc_green_16.png) icon, then the hierarchical
labels and hierarchical sheet pins are matched up correctly. Sheet pins
and labels are considered matching if they have the same name and the
same graphic shape (input, output, bidirectional, tri-state, or
passive).

The column on the left lists sheet pins for the current sheet that do
not have a corresponding hierarchical label in the sheet. The middle
column lists hierarchical labels in the current sheet that do not have a
corresponding hierarchical sheet pin on the sheet symbol. The right
column lists pairs of matching sheet pins and hierarchical labels. The
name of each pin or label is shown along with its graphic shape.

If you click the **Add Hierarchical Labels** button, new hierarchical
labels corresponding to the selected sheet pins will be created for you
to place sequentially in the sheet. The selected sheet pins are then
removed from the left column and added to to the right column for
matching sheet pins and labels. Clicking **Delete Sheet Pins** will
delete the selected sheet pins from the sheet symbol.

If you click the **Add Sheet Pins** button, new sheet pins corresponding
to the selected hierarchical labels will be created for you to place on
the sheet symbol. The hierarchical labels are then removed from the
middle column and added to the right column for matching sheet pins and
labels. Clicking **Delete Hierarchical Labels** will delete the selected
hierarchical labels from inside the sheet.

Clicking the ![add hierarchical label
16](images/icons/add_hierarchical_label_16.png) button will match the
selected sheet pin and hierarchical label by renaming the sheet pin to
match the hierarchical label’s name. Clicking the ![add hierar pin
16](images/icons/add_hierar_pin_16.png) button will do the opposite,
matching the selected sheet pin and hierarchical label by renaming the
label to match the sheet pin.

Clicking the ![left 16](images/icons/left_16.png) button will unmatch a
matched pair, moving both the sheet pin and the hierarchical label back
to their respective unmatched columns. The unmatched sheet pin and
hierarchical label can then be edited or rematched as desired.

Any changes made in the Sync Sheet Pins dialog are applied immediately,
before the dialog is closed. To cancel a change made in the Sync Sheet
Pins dialog, use Undo.

## Hierarchical design examples

Hierarchical designs can be put into one of several categories:

- **Simple:** each sheet is used only once.

- **Complex:** some sheets are instantiated multiple times.

- **Flat:** a sub-case of a **simple** hierarchy, without connections
  between subsheets and their parent. Flat hierarchies can be used to
  represent a non-hierarchical design.

Each hierarchy model can be useful; the most appropriate one depends on
the design.

### Simple hierarchy

An example of a simple hierarchy is the `video` demo project included
with KiCad. The root sheet contains seven unique subsheets, each with
hierarchical labels and sheet pins linking the sheets to each other in
the root sheet. Two of the subsheet symbols are shown below.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_simple_hierarchy.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Simple hierarchy from video demo project" />
</figure>

### Complex Hierarchy

The `complex_hierarchy` demo project is an example of a complex
hierarchy. The root sheet contains two subsheet symbols, which both
refer to the same sheet file (`ampli_ht.kicad_sch`). This allows the
design to include two copies of the same amplifier circuit. Although the
two sheet symbols refer to the same filename, the sheet names are unique
(`ampli_ht_vertical` and `ampli_ht_horizontal`). Inside each subsheet
the circuits are identical except for the reference designators, which
as always are unique.

This project contains no sheet pin connections. The only connections
between the root sheet and the subsheets are global power connections
made with [power symbols](#power-symbols). However, sheets in a complex
hierarchy could include sheet pin connections if appropriate for the
design.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_complex_hierarchy.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Complex hierarchy from complex_hierarchy demo project" />
</figure>

### Flat hierarchy

The `flat_hierarchy` demo project is an example of a flat hierarchy. The
root sheet contains two unique subsheet symbols with no hierarchical
sheet pins. The root sheet in this project does nothing except hold the
subsheets, and the subsheets are used only as additional pages in the
schematic.

<div class="note">

This is the simplest way to create multi-page schematics in KiCad.

# Inspecting a schematic

## Find tool

The Find tool searches for text in the schematic, including reference
designators, pin names, symbol fields, and graphic text. When the tool
finds a match, the canvas is zoomed and centered on the match and the
text is highlighted. Launch the tool using the ![Find
icon](images/icons/find_24.png) button in the top toolbar.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/find_dialog.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="Find dialog" />
</figure>

The Find tool has several options:

- **Match case**: Selects whether the search is case-sensitive.

- **Whole words only**: When selected, the search will only match the
  search term with complete words in the schematic. When unselected, the
  search will match if the search term is part of a larger word in the
  schematic.

- **Regular Expression**: When selected, regular expressions can be used
  in the search terms.

- **Search pin names and numbers**: Selects whether the search should
  apply to pin names and numbers.

- **Search net names**: Selects whether the search should apply to net
  names (labels, symbol pins, sheet pins, and bus members).

- **Search hidden fields**: Selects whether the search should apply only
  to visible fields or if it should include hidden symbol fields.

- **Search the current sheet only**: Selects whether the search should
  be limited to the current schematic sheet.

- **Search the current selection only**: Selects whether the search
  should be limited to the current selection.

There is also a Find and Replace tool which is activated with the ![Find
and Replace icon](images/icons/find_replace_24.png) button in the top
toolbar. This tool behaves the same as the Find tool, but additionally
can replace some or all matches with different text.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/find_replace_dialog.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="Find and Replace dialog" />
</figure>

The Find and Replace tool has the same options as the Find tool, with
one addition:

- **Replace matches in reference designators**: When selected, reference
  designators will be modified if they contain matching text. Otherwise
  reference designators will not be affected.

## Search panel

The search panel is a docked panel that lists information about symbols,
text, and labels from the schematic. Show or hide the search panel with
**View** → **Panels** → **Search** or use the
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+G</span> shortcut.

<figure>
<img src="images/search_panel.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Search panel" />
</figure>

You can optionally filter the list based on a search string. When no
filter is used, all items in the design are listed in the corresponding
tab. Items from the entire schematic are listed, not just items in the
current sheet. Items are filtered based on their properties:

- Symbols and power symbols are filtered by the contents of their
  fields. You can select whether to search hidden fields by enabling the
  **Search Hidden Fields** option in the ![config
  16](images/icons/config_16.png) menu. Symbols are also filtered by
  their metadata (library link, description, and keywords) if **Search
  Metadata** is enabled in the ![config 16](images/icons/config_16.png)
  menu.

- Text (text and textboxes) is filtered by the text content.

- Labels are filtered by their netnames.

You can sort the filtered results in ascending or descending order of
the value in a particular column by clicking on that column header.

Filters support wildcards: `*` matches any characters, and `?` matches
any single character. You can also use [regular
expressions](http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_resyntax.html), such
as `/symbol value/`.

The displayed information depends on the item type:

- All items list their name and/or value, page number, and X/Y location
  in the sheet.

- Symbols additionally list their reference designator, footprint,
  attributes (Exclude from Simulation, Exclude from BOM, Exclude from
  Board, and Do Not Populate), library link (library name and symbol
  name), and description.

- Power symbols additionally list their reference designator.

- Text and labels additionally list their type, e.g. textbox or
  hierarchical.

When you click an item in the search panel, the schematic editor
switches to the item’s schematic sheet, and the item is selected in the
editing canvas. Depending on what is configured in the ![config
16](images/icons/config_16.png) menu, the schematic editor will also pan
and/or zoom to the selected item in the editing canvas. Double-clicking
an item in the search panel opens its properties dialog.

## Net highlighting

An electrical net can be highlighted in the schematic editor to
visualize all of the places it appears in the schematic. Net
highlighting can be activated in the Schematic Editor or by highlighting
the corresponding net in the PCB editor when cross-probe highlighting is
enabled (see below). When net highlighting is active, the highlighted
net will be shown in a different color. By default this color is pink,
but it is configurable in the Color section of the Preferences dialog.

Nets can be highlighted by clicking on a wire or pin using the Highlight
Net tool in the right toolbar (![Net Highlight
icon](images/icons/net_highlight_schematic_24.png)). Alternatively, the
Highlight Net hotkey (\`) highlights the net under the cursor.

Net highlighting can be cleared by using the Clear Net Highlight action
(hotkey ~) or by using the Highlight net tool on an empty region in the
schematic. By default, Esc also clears net highlighting, but this can be
disabled if desired in **Preferences** → **Schematic Editor** →
**Editing Options**.

## Net navigator

The net navigator is a docked panel that shows the location of every
occurrence of a highlighted net in a schematic. Show or hide the net
navigator with **View** → **Panels** → **Net Navigator**.

<figure>
<img src="images/net_navigator.png" alt="net navigator" />
</figure>

When you highlight a net in the schematic, every place where that net is
shown in the schematic is listed in the net navigator panel. All labels,
symbol pins, and sheet pins connected to the net are listed. Each
occurrence is sorted under its schematic sheet. Clicking on an
occurrence displays that item in the editing canvas.

When no net is highlighted, the net navigator displays this information
for all nets in the schematic.

<div class="note">

The net navigator displays [highlighted](#net-highlighting) nets, not
selected nets.

</div>

With the net navigator open and a net highlighted, you can quickly
select various items on that net (net labels, sheet pins, and symbol
pins) by selecting one of the items on the highlighted net in the
schematic canvas and pressing
Tab/<span class="keycombo">Shift+Tab</span> to cycle through the net
items. Pressing Tab selects the next item on the net, while
<span class="keycombo">Shift+Tab</span> selects the previous item.

## Cross-probing from the PCB

KiCad allows bi-directional cross-probing between the schematic and the
PCB. There are several different types of cross-probing.

**Selection cross-probing** allows you to select a symbol or pin in the
schematic to select the corresponding footprint or pad in the PCB (if
one exists) and vice-versa. By default, cross-probing will result in the
display centering on the cross-probed item and zooming to fit. You can
disable the centering and zooming behavior, or disable selection
cross-probing entirely, in the Display Options section of the
Preferences dialog. Even when selection cross-probing is disabled, you
can manually cross-probe from the schematic to the PCB by right-clicking
an object and selecting **Select on PCB**, or from the PCB to the
schematic by right-clicking an object **and choosing \*Select **→**
Select on Schematic**\*.

**Highlight cross-probing** allows you to highlight a net in the
schematic and PCB at the same time. If the option "Highlight
cross-probed nets" is enabled in the Display Options section of the
Preferences dialog, highlighting a net or bus in the schematic editor
will cause the corresponding net or nets to be highlighted in the PCB
editor, and vice versa.

## Electrical rules checking

The Electrical Rules Checker (ERC) tool checks for certain errors in
your schematic, such as unconnected pins, unconnected hierarchical
symbols, shorted outputs or other illegal connections, etc. ERC
violations are reported as errors or warnings depending on the severity
of the issue detected.

ERC is imperfect and cannot detect all errors, but it can detect many
common issues and oversights. All detected issues should be checked and
addressed before proceeding. The quality of the ERC is directly related
to the care taken in declaring [electrical pin
properties](#pin-electrical-types) during symbol creation. If symbols
are designed incorrectly, ERC will not report accurate information.

ERC can be started by clicking on the ![ERC
icon](images/icons/erc_24.png) button in the top toolbar and clicking
the **Run ERC** button.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/dialog_erc.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="ERC dialog" />
</figure>

Any warnings or errors are reported in the **Violations** tab, and
markers for each violation are placed in the schematic so that they
point to the relevant part of the schematic. Warnings are indicated by
yellow arrows, and errors have red arrows. Excluded violations are shown
as green arrows. A list of the ignored tests are shown in the **Ignored
Tests** tab. A report file in plain text format can be created after
running DRC using the **Save…​** button.

<div class="note">

Selecting a violation in the ERC window jumps to the selected violation
marker in the schematic.

</div>

The numbers at the bottom of the window show the number of errors,
warnings, and exclusions. Each type of violation can be filtered from
the list using the respective checkboxes. Clicking **Delete Marker**
will clear the selected violation until ERC is run again, while clicking
**Delete All Markers** will clear all violations until the next ERC run.

Violations can be right-clicked in the dialog to ignore them or change
their severity:

<figure>
<img src="images/erc_ignore_warning.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Ignore ERC warning" />
</figure>

- **Exclude this violation:** ignores this particular violation, but
  does not affect any other violations. You can un-exclude a violation
  by right clicking the excluded violation and selecting **Remove
  exclusion for this violation**.

- **Exclude with comment…​:** the same as **Exclude this violation**, but
  prompts for a comment explaining the reason for the exclusion. When
  excluded violations are unhidden (using the **Exclusions** checkbox),
  exclusion comments are shown with the corresponding excluded
  violation. To edit an existing exclusion comment or add a comment to
  an existing exclusion, right click an excluded violation and select
  **Edit exclusion comment…​**.

- **Change severity:** changes a type of violation from warning to
  error, or error to warning. This affects all violations of a given
  type.

- **Ignore all:** ignores all violations of a given type. This test will
  now appear in the **Ignored Tests** tab rather than the **Violations**
  tab. You can un-ignore the test again by right clicking the test in
  the **Ignored Tests** tab, or in the Violation Severity panel in
  [Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup).

- \*Edit violation severities…​: opens the Violation severity panel in
  [Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup), for editing the severities of all
  DRC violation types.

You can also exclude the selected marker with **Inspect** → **Exclude
Marker**, and show or hide each category of marker (errors, warnings,
and exclusions) with the **View** menu.

Excluded and ignored violations are remembered between runs of the
design rule checker. Excluded violations are hidden unless the
**Exclusions** checkbox is enabled. Ignored violations are not shown,
but there is a list of ignored tests in the **Ignored Tests** tab.

### ERC example

<figure>
<img src="images/erc_pointers.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="ERC pointers" />
</figure>

There are three errors in the screenshot above.

- Two outputs have been connected together (red arrow at right).

- Two inputs have been left unconnected (red arrows at left). This is
  actually two errors per pin: each pin is unconnected, and each pin is
  an input pin that is not driven by an output pin.

Selecting an ERC marker displays a description of the violation in the
message pane at the bottom of the window.

<figure>
<img src="images/erc_pointers_message.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="ERC violation description in message pane" />
</figure>

### Per-net ERC markers

Some violations are reported only once per net. For example, the "Input
Power pin not driven by any Output Power pins" error technically applies
to each Input Power pin on an un-driven net, but only one marker is
shown per net. This is to avoid producing a large number of markers for
a single root cause. In this case, exactly where the marker is placed in
the schematic is arbitrary and does not necessarily indicate the ideal
location for fixing the issue.

In the example below, there are four un-driven Input Power pins (one per
power symbol), but only two ERC markers. Adding two `PWR_FLAG` symbols,
one to each un-driven net, will clear the errors. The "correct" location
for the `PWR_FLAG` symbol depends on the schematic and may not be near
the particular power symbol where the marker was placed, or even in the
same schematic sheet.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_erc_single_marker.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Single marker for multiple violations on the same net" />
</figure>

### Power pins and power flags

It is common to have an "Input Power pin not driven by any Output Power
pins" error on power pins, as shown in the example below, even though
the power pins seem to be properly connected to a power rail. This
happens in designs where the power is provided through connectors or
other components that are not marked as power outputs. In these cases
ERC won’t detect any Output Power pins connected to the net and will
determine the Input Power pin is not driven by a power source.

For example, in the below schematic, `VCC` and `GND` are connected to a
connector with passive pins, so the Input Power pins of `U1` are not
considered driven by a power source.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_power_pins_and_flags.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Power pins and error flags" />
</figure>

To avoid this warning, connect the net to `PWR_FLAG` symbol on such a
power net as shown in the following example. The `PWR_FLAG` symbol is
found in the `power` symbol library. Alternatively, connect any Output
Power pin to the net; `PWR_FLAG` is simply a symbol with a single Output
Power pin.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_power_pins_and_flags_fixed.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="Power pins with PWR_FLAGs" />
</figure>

Ground nets often need a `PWR_FLAG` to be manually added, even when
power rails do not, because voltage regulators have outputs declared as
Output Power, but their ground pins are typically marked as Power
Inputs. Therefore grounds are not considered driven by these voltage
regulators. This is so multiple regulators can share a common ground
without errors caused by two Output Power pins being connected together.

Power nets do not "jump" across components, so, components like passive
inline filtering elements may need a `PWR_FLAG` on their downstream side
to indicate that the net is still connected to a power source.

In the below schematic, although there is a `PWR_FLAG` on the nets
connected to the connectors (`VCC_IN` and `GND_IN`), a `PWR_FLAG` is
also needed to mark each of `VCC` and `GND` as power nets, because the
filter `FL1` has only Passive pins.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_power_pins_and_flags_filter.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Power pins with PWR_FLAG on both sides of a filter" />
</figure>

This would be the case also if the `VCC_IN` and `GND_IN` nets were
connected to a symbol with Output Power pins. In fact, in this
schematic, the `PWR_FLAG` symbols are on `VCC_IN` and `GND_IN` are not
required, as there are no Input Power pins on those nets.

For more information about power pins and power flags, see the
[`PWR_FLAG` documentation](#pwr-flag).

### ERC Configuration

The **Violation Severity** panel in [Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup)
lets you configure what types of ERC messages should be reported as
Errors, Warnings, or ignored.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_erc_severity.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Schematic ERC severity settings" />
</figure>

The **Pin Conflicts Map** panel in [Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup)
allows you to configure connectivity rules to define electrical
conditions for errors and warnings based on what types of pins are
connected to each other. For example, by default an error is produced
when an output pin is connected to another output pin.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_erc_options.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Schematic ERC Pin Conflicts Map" />
</figure>

Rules can be changed by clicking on the desired square of the matrix,
causing it to cycle through the choices: allowed, warning, error.

### List of ERC checks

The table below lists the electrical rules that KiCad checks and the
default violation severity for each check. All severities are
configurable.

#### Connections ERC checks

These ERC checks look for issues with wire and label connections in the
schematic.

| Violation                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Default Severity         |

| Pin not connected                                         | This violation occurs when a symbol pin is not connected to a net, unless the pin has a [no-connect flag](#no-connection-symbols) or has electrical type Unconnected.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Error                    |
| Input pin not driven by any Output pins                   | This violation occurs when a symbol pin with electrical type Input is not connected to a driving pin. Driving pins are pins with the type output, bidirectional, tristate, power output, or passive pins.                                                                                                                                                         | Error                    |
| Input Power pin not driven by any Output Power pins       | This violation occurs when a symbol pin with electrical type Input Power is not connected to an Output Power pin. A common cause of this violation is [described above](#power-pins-and-power-flags).                                                                                                                                                             | Error                    |
| A pin with a "no connection" flag is connected            | The violation occurs when a symbol pin with a [no connection flag](#no-connection-symbols) is connected to a net.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Warning                  |
| Unconnected "no connection" flag                          | This violation occurs when a [No connection flag](#no-connection-symbols) is not connected to a pin or label.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Warning                  |
| Label not connected to anything                           | This violation occurs when a global, hierarchical, local, or directive label is not connected to a pin or another label.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Error                    |
| Global label not connected anywhere else in the schematic | This violation occurs when there are fewer than two symbol pins on a net with a global label (if there are fewer than two pins, then the label isn’t being used to connect anything as it is only connected to a single symbol pin).                                                                                                                              | Warning                  |
| Global label only appears once in the schematic           | This violation occurs when a global label only appears once in the schematic, meaning that the label is not forming any global connections. This violation is ignored by default to allow users to use global labels to label nets, even if the net does not connect anywhere else.                                                                               | Ignore                   |
| Local and global labels have the same name                | This violation occurs when a local label has the same name as a global label. If these labels are on separate sheets, they will not connect, although they may have been intended to connect. Note that while a local label and a global label with the same name won’t connect if they are on different sheets, they will connect if they are on the same sheet. | Warning                  |
| Wires not connected to anything                           | This violation occurs when a wire is not connected to any pin or label.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Error                    |
| Bus Entry needed                                          | This violation only applies to projects imported from EAGLE projects. It indicates places where the importer was unable to automatically add bus entries to the imported schematic, so you must add them by hand.                                                                                                                                                 | Error                    |
| Symbol pin or wire end off connection grid                | This violation occurs when a symbol pin or wire end is not aligned to the connection grid. Symbol pins and wire ends need to be aligned to the grid in order to connect to each other. The grid used for this check is defined by the **connection grid** setting in [**Schematic Setup** → **Formatting** → **Connection grid**](#schematic-setup-formatting).   | Warning                  |
| Four connection points are joined together                | This violation occurs when wires join in a four-way (cross) junction. Such junctions are sometimes considered harmful because it can be unclear if all four wires are intended to be joined or if two wires were intended to cross without a junction.                                                                                                            | Ignore                   |
| Multiple pins with the same pin number                    | This violation occurs when two pins in the same symbol have the same pin number. Symbol pins must be uniquely numbered within a symbol, and therefore this violation is always an error.                                                                                                                                                                          | Error (not configurable) |
| Label connects more than one wire                         | This violation occurs when a label anchor connects to two wires (where two wires cross without connecting). In this situation is not possible to determine which net the label should connect to.                                                                                                                                                                 | Warning                  |
| Unconnected wire endpoint                                 | This violation occurs when a wire endpoint is not connected to anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Warning                  |

#### Conflicts ERC checks

| Duplicate reference designators                                      | This violation occurs when two symbols have the same reference designator.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Error            |
| Units of same symbol have different values                           | This violation occurs when units of a single symbol have different values.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Error            |
| Different footprint assigned in another unit of the symbol           | This violation occurs when units of a single symbol have different assigned footprints.                                                                                                                                                                               | Error            |
| Different net assigned to a shared pin in another unit of the symbol | This violation occurs when a pin that is shared between multiple units of a symbol is not connected to the same net in each unit.                                                                                                                                     | Error            |
| Duplicate sheet names within a given sheet                           | This violation occurs when two hierarchical sheets in the same parent sheet have the same name.                                                                                                                                                                       | Error            |
| Mismatch between hierarchical labels and sheet pins                  | This violation occurs when a hierarchical label does not have a corresponding hierarchical sheet pin in the parent sheet, or a hierarchical sheet pin does not have a corresponding hierarchical label in the child sheet.                                            | Error            |
| More than one name given given to this bus or net                    | This violation occurs when a net has multiple labels attached. Nets can only have a single name, so if multiple labels are attached to a net, one name will be selected and used as the canonical name.                                                               | Warning          |
| Conflict between bus alias definitions across schematic sheets       | This violation occurs when a bus alias has different members in different sheets. If the same bus alias name is used in multiple sheets, the members of the alias must be the same for each sheet.                                                                    | Error            |
| Buses are graphically connected but share no bus members             | This violation occurs when buses that are graphically connected do not have bus members in common.                                                                                                                                                                    | Error            |
| Invalid connection between bus and net items                         | This violation occurs when a bus is connected to a net item, such as a wire, a label referring to a single net, or a sheet pin referring to a single net. Labels and sheet pins can only be connected to buses if they refer to buses rather than individual signals. | Error            |
| Net is graphically connected to a bus but not a bus member           | This violation occurs when a net is connected to a bus with a bus entry but the net is not a member of that bus.                                                                                                                                                      | Warning          |

### User-definable ERC violations

You can manually trigger schematic ERC warnings or errors using special
[text variables](#text-variables). These items will appear as errors or
warnings when ERC runs. This can be useful to flag items for later
followup or review.

To cause an ERC violation, use the text variable
`${ERC_ERROR <violation name>}` or `${ERC_WARNING <violation name>}`
depending on whether an error or warning is desired. You can place this
in a text item, text box, or field, including symbol fields, sheet
fields, and label fields. When ERC runs, this will generate a ERC
violation with the given violation name. These text variables resolve to
an empty string in the schematic, and any text after the braces is
included in the ERC violation’s description. The text variable must be
placed at the start of the text object in order to trigger a violation.

For example, a text item containing
`${ERC_ERROR TODO}Calculate resistor value` will appear in the board as
just the text "Calculate resistor value", and will generate an ERC error
named "TODO" with "Calculate resistor value" in the description.

### ERC report file

An ERC report file can be generated and saved by clicking the **Save…​**
button in the ERC dialog. The file extension for ERC report files is
`.rpt`. An example ERC report file is given below.

# Assigning Footprints

Before routing a PCB, footprints need to be selected for every component
that will be assembled on the board. Footprints define the copper
connections between physical components and the routed traces on a
circuit board.

Some symbols come with footprints pre-assigned, but for many symbols
there are multiple possible footprints, so the user needs to select the
appropriate one.

KiCad offers several ways to assign footprints:

- Symbol Properties

  - Symbol Properties Dialog

  - Symbol Fields Table

- While placing symbols

- Footprint Assignment Tool

Each method will be explained below. Which to use is a matter of
preference; one method may be more convenient depending on the
situation. All of these methods are equivalent in that they store the
name of the selected footprint in the symbol’s `Footprint` field.

<div class="note">

The Footprint Library Table needs to be configured before footprints can
be assigned. For information on configuring the Footprint Library Table,
please see the [PCB Editor
manual](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#managing-footprint-libraries).

</div>

## Assigning Footprints in Symbol Properties

A symbol’s `Footprint` field can be edited directly in the symbol’s
Properties window.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_symbol_properties_footprint.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="Assigning footprint in Symbol Properties" />
</figure>

Clicking the ![library icon](images/icons/small_library_16.png) button
in the `Footprint` field opens the Footprint Chooser, which shows the
available footprints sorted by footprint libraries.

The Footprint Chooser filters footprints by name, description, and
keywords, as well as any fields that are shown as columns, according to
what you type into the search field. `*` and `?` wildcards are
available. The footprint search behaves the same as in the [symbol
chooser dialog](#placing-symbols).

If the symbol defines any [footprint filters](#footprint-filters), the
**apply footprint filters** option can be used to hide footprints that
don’t match those filters. If the **filter by pin count** option is
selected, only footprints that match the symbol’s pincount will be
listed. You can choose to sort search results alphabetically or by best
match by clicking on the ![sort
button](images/icons/small_sort_desc_16.png) button.

Single clicking a footprint name selects the footprint and displays it
in the preview pane on the right. You can switch between a 2D and 3D
preview of the footprint by clicking the ![2D component
icon](images/icons/module_16.png) and ![3D component
icon](images/icons/three_d_16.png) buttons. Double clicking on a
footprint closes the chooser and sets the symbol’s `Footprint` field to
the selected footprint.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_chooser.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Selecting a footprint in Footprint Chooser" />
</figure>

### Assigning Footprints with the Symbol Fields Table

Rather than editing the properties of each symbol individually, the
Symbol Fields Table can be used to view and edit the properties of all
symbols in the design in one place. This includes assigning footprints
by editing the `Footprint` field of each symbol.

The Symbol Fields Table is accessed with **Tools** → **Edit Symbol
Fields…​**, or with the ![Symbol Fields Table
Icon](images/icons/spreadsheet_24.png) button on the top toolbar.

The `Footprint` field behaves the same here as in the Symbol Properties
window: it can be edited directly, or footprints can be selected
visually with the Footprint Library Browser.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_symbol_fields_table_footprint.png"
style="width:90.0%"
alt="Bulk editing footprint assignments with the Symbol Fields Table" />
</figure>

For more information on the Symbol Fields Table, see the [section on
editing symbol properties](#symbol-fields-table).

## Assigning Footprints While Placing Symbols

Footprints can be assigned to symbols when the symbol is first added to
the schematic.

Some symbols are defined with a default footprint. These symbols will
have this footprint preassigned when they are added to the schematic. If
a symbol has a default footprint, the footprint will be graphically
previewed in the symbol chooser dialog when the symbol is selected. For
symbols without a default symbol defined, the footprint dropdown will
say "No default footprint", and the footprint preview canvas will say
"No footprint specified".

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_add_symbol_default_footprint.png"
alt="Default footprint in Add Symbol dialog" />
</figure>

Symbols can have footprint filters that specify which footprints are
appropriate to use with that symbol. If footprint filters are defined
for the selected symbol, all footprints that match the footprint filters
will appear as options in the footprint dropdown. The selected footprint
will be displayed in the preview canvas and will be assigned to the
symbol when the symbol is added to the schematic.

<div class="note">

Footprint options will not appear in the footprint dropdown unless the
footprint libraries are loaded. Footprint libraries are loaded the first
time the Footprint Editor or Footprint Library Browser are opened in a
session.

</div>

For more information on footprint filters, see the [Symbol Editor
Documentation](#footprint-filters).

## Assigning Footprints with the Footprint Assignment Tool

The Footprint Assignment Tool allows you to associate symbols in your
schematic to footprints used when laying out the printed circuit board.
It provides footprint list filtering, footprint viewing, and 3D
component model viewing to help ensure the correct footprint is
associated with each component.

Components can be assigned to their corresponding footprints manually or
automatically by creating equivalence files (.equ files). Equivalence
files are lookup tables associating each component with its footprint.

Run the tool with **Tools** → **Assign Footprints…​**, or by clicking the
![Footprint Assignment Tool icon](images/icons/icon_cvpcb_24_24.png)
icon in the top toolbar.

### Footprint Assignment Tool Overview

### Manually Assigning Footprints with the Footprint Assignment Tool

To manually associate a footprint with a component, first select a
component in the component (middle) pane. Then select a footprint in the
footprint (right) pane by double-clicking on the name of the desired
footprint. The footprint will be assigned to the selected component, and
the next component without an assigned footprint is automatically
selected.

<div class="note">

If no footprints appear in the footprint pane, check that the [footprint
filter options](#filtering-the-footprint-list) are correctly applied.

</div>

When all components have footprints assigned to them, click the **OK**
button to save the assignments and exit the tool. Alternatively, click
**Cancel** to discard the updated assignments, or **Apply, Save
Schematic & Continue** to save the new assignments without exiting the
tool.

#### Filtering the Footprint List

There are four filtering options which restrict which footprints are
displayed in the footprint pane. The filtering options are enabled and
disabled with three buttons and a textbox in the top toolbar.

- ![module filtered list 24](images/icons/module_filtered_list_24.png):
  Activate [filters that can be defined in each
  symbol](#footprint-filters). For example, an opamp symbol might define
  filters that show only SOIC and DIP footprints.

- ![module pin filtered list
  24](images/icons/module_pin_filtered_list_24.png): Only show
  footprints that match the selected symbol’s pin count.

- ![module library list 24](images/icons/module_library_list_24.png):
  Only show footprints from the library selected in the left pane.

- Entering text in the textbox hides footprints that do not match the
  text. This filter is disabled when the box is empty.

When all filters are disabled, the full footprint list is shown.

The applied filters are described in the bottom pane of the window,
along with the number of footprints that meet the selected filters. For
example, when the symbol’s footprint filters and pin count filters are
enabled, the bottom pane prints the footprint filters and pin count:

<figure>
<img src="images/en/filter_details.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Filter details when symbol footprint filters and pin count filter are enabled" />
</figure>

Multiple filters can be used at once to help narrow down the list of
possibly appropriate footprints in the footprint pane. The symbols in
KiCad’s standard library define footprint filters that are designed to
be used in combination with the pin count filter.

### Automatically Assigning Footprints with the Footprint Assignment Tool

The Footprint Assignment Tool allows you to store footprint assignments
in an external file and load the assignments later, even in a different
project. This allows you to automatically associate symbols with the
appropriate footprints.

The external file is referred to as an equivalence file, and it stores a
mapping of a symbol value to a corresponding footprint. Equivalence
files typically use the `.equ` file extension. Equivalence files are
plain text files with a simple syntax, and must be created by the user
using a text editor. The syntax is described below.

You can select which equivalence files to use by clicking
**Preferences** → **Manage Footprint Association Files** in the
Footprint Assignment Tool.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/cvpcb_equivalence_files.png"
alt="Managing equivalence files" />
</figure>

- Add new equivalence files by clicking the **Add** button.

- Remove the selected equivalence file by clicking the **Remove**
  button.

- Change the priority of equivalence files by clicking the **Move Up**
  and **Move Down** buttons. If a symbol’s value is found in multiple
  equivalence files, the footprint from the last matching equivalence
  file will override earlier equivalence files.

- Open the selected equivalence file by clicking the **Edit File**
  button.

Relevant environment variables are shown at the bottom of the window.
When the **Relative** path option is checked, these environment
variables will automatically be used to make paths to selected
equivalence files relative to the project or footprint libraries.

Once the desired equivalence files have been loaded in the correct
order, automatic footprint association can be performed by clicking the
![Perform automatic footprint assignment
icon](images/icons/auto_associate_24.png) button in the top toolbar of
the Footprint Assignment Tool.

All symbols with a value found in a loaded equivalence file will have
their footprints automatically assigned. However, symbols that already
have footprints assigned will not be updated.

#### Equivalence File Format

Equivalence files consist of one line for each symbol value. Each line
has the following structure:

`'<symbol value>' '<footprint library>:<footprint name>'`

Each name/value must be surrounded by single quotes (`'`) and separated
by one or more spaces. Lines starting with `#` are comments.

For example, if you want all symbols with the value `LM4562` to be
assigned the footprint `Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm`, the line in
the equivalence file should be:

`'LM4562' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'`

Here is an example equivalence file:

    #integrated circuits (smd):
    '74LV14' 'Package_SO:SOIC-14_3.9x8.7mm_P1.27mm'
    'EL7242C' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'DS1302N' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'LM324N' 'Package_SO:SOIC-14_3.9x8.7mm_P1.27mm'
    'LM358' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'LTC1878' 'Package_SO:MSOP-8_3x3mm_P0.65mm'
    '24LC512I/SM' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'LM2903M' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'LT1129_SO8' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'LT1129CS8-3.3' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'LT1129CS8' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'LM358M' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'TL7702BID' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'TL7702BCD' 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_3.9x4.9_P1.27mm'
    'U2270B' 'Package_SO:SOIC-16_3.9x9.9_P1.27mm'

    #regulators
    'LP2985LV' 'Package_TO_SOT_SMD:SOT-23-5_HandSoldering'

# Forward and back annotation

## Update PCB from Schematic (forward annotation)

Use the Update PCB from Schematic tool to sync design information from
the Schematic Editor to the Board Editor. The tool can be accessed with
**Tools** → **Update PCB from Schematic** (F8) in both the schematic and
board editors. You can also use the ![Update PCB from Schematic
icon](images/icons/update_pcb_from_sch_24.png) icon in the top toolbar
of the Board Editor. This process is often called forward annotation.

<div class="note">

Update PCB from Schematic is the preferred way to transfer design
information from the schematic to the PCB. In older versions of KiCad,
the equivalent process was to export a netlist from the Schematic Editor
and import it into the Board Editor. It is no longer necessary to use a
netlist file.

</div>

</figure>

The tool adds the footprint for each symbol to the board and transfers
updated schematic information to the board. In particular, the board’s
net connections are updated to match the schematic. Symbols with the
[**Exclude from board** attribute](#editing-symbol-properties) are not
transferred to the PCB.

The changes that will be made to the PCB are listed in the *Changes To
Be Applied* pane. The PCB is not modified until you click the **Update
PCB** button.

You can show or hide different types of messages using the checkboxes at
the bottom of the window. A report of the changes can be saved to a file
using the **Save…​** button.

### Re-linking symbols and footprints

Symbols and footprints are linked together using unique identifiers
(also called UUIDs). These are handled automatically within KiCad and
are not usually visible to users. They allow a symbol and its partner
footprint to keep their connection between schematic and PCB, even if
the reference designator is changed. New objects get assigned their
identifiers upon creation.

#### Re-linking by unique identifier (default)

In normal use, the **Re-link footprints to schematic symbols based on
their reference designators** option should be unchecked. In this mode,
symbols with the same identifier as a footprint will update that
footprint, regardless of the reference designator. Symbols which have an
identifier that doesn’t match any footprint will add a new footprint
linked to that identifier.

For example, in the below schematic, both `R1` and `R2` are linked via
their unique IDs to footprints on the PCB:

<figure>
<img src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_ID_link_before_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by unique identifier, before a change in reference designator" />
</figure>

If symbol reference designators are changed in the schematic (e.g. by
re-annotation), running the **Update PCB from Schematic** process will
update the reference designators on the PCB.

<figure>
<img src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_ID_link_after_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by unique identifier, after a change in reference designator" />
</figure>

#### Re-linking by reference designator

If the checkbox is checked, the linking process is done using the
reference designators. This can be useful for workflows that result in a
symbol being deleted and replaced by another one, rather than being
updated in-place. For example, cut-and-pasting a block of schematic or a
sheet and copy-pasting and re-annotating will usually break the
identifier-based links.

For example in the below case, the resistors `R1` and `R2` have been
deleted and replaced, then re-annotated. While the reference designators
are the same, the internal identifiers have changed. Updating the PCB by
identifier would cause the existing footprints to be deleted and new
ones added - to KiCad, the existing footprints have no matching symbol.
This would cause the footprints to lose their positions and need placing
again.

<figure>
<img
src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_RefDes_link_before_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by reference designator, after deleting and replacing symbols, but before updating the PCB" />
</figure>

Re-linking the footprints by reference designator causes KiCad to
re-create the links, using the matching reference designators as a
guide.

<figure>
<img
src="images/Forward_annotation_linking_-_RefDes_link_after_update.png"
style="width:70.0%"
alt="Forward annotation linking by reference designator, after updating the PCB" />
</figure>

Because the links have been re-established, the next forward annotation
should use the normal identifier-based linking (i.e. the checkbox should
be unchecked).

## Update Schematic from PCB (back annotation)

The typical workflow in KiCad is to make changes in the schematic and
then sync the changes to the board using the Update PCB From Schematic
tool. However, the reverse process is also possible: design changes can
be made in the board and then synced back to the schematic using
**Tools** → **Update Schematic From PCB** in either the schematic or
board editors. This process is also known as backannotation.

<figure>
<img src="images/update_schematic_from_pcb.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Update schematic from PCB" />
</figure>

The tool syncs changes in reference designators, values, attributes
(like DNP or Exclude From BOM), footprint assignments, other fields, and
net names from the board to the schematic. Each type of change can be
individually enabled or disabled.

The changes that will be made to the schematic are listed in the
*Changes To Be Applied* pane. The schematic is not modified until you
click the **Update Schematic** button.

You can show or hide different types of messages using the checkboxes at
the bottom of the window. A report of the changes can be saved to a file
using the **Save…​** button.

<div class="note">

The [Geographical
Reannotation](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#geographical-re-annotation) feature
can be used in combination with backannotating reference designators to
reannotate all components in the design based on their location in the

</div>

### Back annotation with CMP files

Select changes can also be synced from the PCB back to the schematic by
exporting a CMP file from the PCB editor (**File** → **Export** →
**Footprint Association (.cmp) File…​**) and importing it in the
Schematic Editor (**File** → **Import** → **Footprint Assignments…​**).

# Generating Outputs

## Printing

KiCad can print the schematic to a standard printer using
**File**→**Print…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_print.png" alt="Print dialog" />
</figure>

### Printing options

- **Print drawing sheet:** Include the drawing sheet border and title
  block in the printed schematic.

- **Output mode:** Print the schematic in color or black and white.

- **Print background color:** Include the background color in the
  printed schematic. This option is only enabled when printing in color.

- **Use a different color theme for printing:** Select a different color
  scheme for printing than the one selected for display in the Schematic
  Editor.

- **Page Setup…​:** Opens a page setup dialog for setting paper size and
  orientation.

- **Close:** Closes the dialog without printing.

- **Print:** Opens the system print dialog.

<div class="note">

Printing uses platform- and printer-specific drivers and may have
unexpected results. When printing to a file, **Plotting** is recommended
instead of **Printing**.

</div>

## Plotting

KiCad can plot schematics to a file using **File** → **Plot…​**.

The supported output formats are Postscript, PDF, SVG, and DXF.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_plot.png" alt="Plot dialog" />
</figure>

The **Output Messages** pane displays messages about the generated
files. Different kinds of messages can be shown or hidden using the
checkboxes, and the messages can be saved to a file using the **Save…​**
button.

The **Plot Current Page** button plots the current page of the
schematic. The **Plot All Pages** button plots all pages of the
schematic. One file is generated for each page, except for PDF output,
which plots each schematic page as a separate page in a single PDF file.

### Plotting options

- **Output directory:** Specify the location to save plotted files. If
  this is a relative path, it is created relative to the project
  directory. This path can use [text variables](#text-variables),
  including both project text variables and built-in text variables.

- **Output Format:** Select the format to plot in. Some formats have
  different options than others.

- **Page size:** Sets the page size to use for the plotted output. This
  can be set to match the schematic size or to another sheet size.

- **Plot drawing sheet:** Include the drawing sheet border and title
  block in the printed schematic.

- **Output mode:** Sets the output to color or black and white. Not all
  output formats support color.

- **Color theme:** Selects the color theme to use for the plotted
  output.

- **Plot background color:** Includes the schematic background color in
  the plotted output. The background color will not be plotted if the
  output format does not support color or the output mode is black and
  white.

- **Minimum line width:** Selects the minimum width for lines. Any lines
  narrower than this width will be plotted with this minimum width.

- **Generate property popups:** Enables the interactive PDF features
  described below. This option only applies for PDF output.

- **Generate clickable links for hierarchical elements:** Enables
  clickable hierarchical sheets, hierarchical sheet pins, and
  hierarchical labels. When enabled, clicking a hierarchical sheet or
  sheet pin in the PDF will open the PDF page for that subsheet.
  Clicking a hierarchical label will open the page for the parent sheet.
  If **Generate property popups** is also enabled, links will be
  generated instead of property popups for hierarchical sheets, pins,
  and labels (i.e. this option takes priority). This option only applies
  for PDF output.

- **Generate metadata from AUTHOR and SUBJECT variables:** Sets the
  Author and Subject PDF document properties for the generated PDF based
  on the `AUTHOR` and `SUBJECT` [project text
  variables](#schematic-setup-text-variables), if you have defined them.
  This option only applies for PDF output.

- **Open file after plot:** automatically opens the plotted output file
  when plotting is complete.

### Interactive PDF features

Plotted PDFs can optionally have several interactive features.

<figure>
<img src="images/pdf_interactive_symbol_details.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="symbol fields popup" />
</figure>

- Hyperlinks can be clicked.

- The table of contents is populated with schematic sheets as well as
  the symbols and hierarchical labels in each sheet.

- Clicking on many schematic elements displays a popup menu containing
  relevant information.

  - Symbols display their symbol fields.

  - Hierarchical subsheets display their sheetname and filename, as well
    as an option to enter the sheet itself. This is replaced by a direct
    link to the subsheet if the **Generate clickable links for
    hierarchical elements** option is enabled.

  - Labels display the resolved net and netclass.

  - Buses display their members.

<div class="note">

Some of these features are not supported in all PDF readers. The
clickable links generated by the **Generate clickable links for
hierarchical elements** option are more widely supported than other
interactive features.

</div>

## Generating a bill of materials

KiCad can generate a bill of materials that lists all of the components
in the design. BOMs are configurable: you can select which components
are included, how components are ordered, which symbol fields are
included and in what order, and what the output format is.

BOMs are exported using the [Symbol Fields Table](#symbol-fields-table).
As a shortcut to open the **Export** tab of this dialog, you can select
**Tools** → **Generate Bill of Materials…​** or use the ![BOM
icon](images/icons/post_bom_24.png) button on the top toolbar.

The contents of the BOM are configured in the **Edit** tab. The format
of the exported BOM file is configured in the **Export** tab. The BOM is
written when you press the **Export** button at the bottom of the
dialog.

### BOM contents

The exported BOM will contain exactly the components (rows) and fields
(columns) shown in the **Edit** tab, with the same grouping and sorting.
Components with the **Exclude from BOM** attribute set are hidden in the
**Edit** tab and not included in the BOM export unless the **Show
'Exclude from BOM'** box is checked. Components with the DNP (do not
populate) attribute set can be optionally excluded from both the table
in the **Edit** tab and the exported BOM by checking the **Exclude DNP**
box. You can also limit the displayed components to those in the current
sheet, the current sheet and all of its subsheets, or the entire
schematic by adjusting the **Scope** settings.

<figure>
<img src="images/symbol_fields_table_edit.png"
alt="Symbol Fields Table Edit tab" />
</figure>

Fields with the **Show** box checked will be included as columns in the
BOM, and fields with the **Group By** box checked are used to group
components together. Components are grouped into the same line if all of
their **Group By** fields are identical and the **Group symbols** box is
checked. You can set an arbitrary column name for each field and reorder
columns by dragging their headers.

Presets are available to configure the list of fields. Presets store
which fields are displayed, which fields are used for grouping, and the
column order. You can create and save your own presets or use one of
several default presets. Custom presets can be deleted in this dialog or
in the [Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup) dialog.

The built-in presets "Grouped By Value" and "Grouped By Value and
Footprint" replicate [legacy BOM scripts](#legacy-bom-export), while
"Attributes" shows only the reference and value fields and the DNP,
exclude from board, exclude from simulation, and exclude from BOM
attributes.

Some virtual fields are available that may be useful in BOM exports.
Adding a field in the Symbol Fields Table beginning with a [text
variable](#text-variables) will not create a new field in the symbols,
but will create a special column in the table and BOM with
auto-generated values for each component. The following variables may be
especially useful for creating virtual fields in custom BOM formats:

- `${QUANTITY}` creates a field that contains the number of grouped
  instances of that component.

- `${ITEM_NUMBER}` creates a field that contains the row number of the
  component in the BOM.

- `${SYMBOL_NAME}` creates a field that contains the name of the
  schematic symbol.

- `${SYMBOL_LIBRARY}` creates a field that contains the name of the
  schematic symbol library.

- `${DNP}` creates a field with a checkbox that controls the component’s
  DNP attribute. In the BOM, this field resolves to the string "DNP" if
  the component’s DNP attribute is set, or an empty string otherwise.

- `${EXCLUDE_FROM_BOARD}` creates a field with a checkbox that controls
  the component’s exclude from board attribute. In the BOM, this field
  resolves to the string "Excluded from board" if the component’s
  exclude from board attribute is set, or an empty string otherwise.

- `${EXCLUDE_FROM_SIM}` creates a field with a checkbox that controls
  the component’s exclude from simulation attribute. In the BOM, this
  field resolves to the string "Excluded from simulation" if the
  component’s exclude from simulation attribute is set, or an empty
  string otherwise.

- `${EXCLUDE_FROM_BOM}` creates a field with a checkbox that controls
  the component’s exclude from BOM attribute. Components with the
  exclude from BOM attribute set are not included in the BOM.

Other text variables are also available.

The full functionality of the **Edit** tab, including virtual field
behavior, is explained in more detail in the [Symbol Fields Table
documentation](#symbol-fields-table).

### BOM format

The **Export** tab contains settings concerning the output file format
for the BOM and displays a preview of the raw BOM file output.

<figure>
<img src="images/symbol_fields_table_export.png"
alt="Symbol Fields Table Export tab" />
</figure>

At the top you can specify the output file. Pressing the **Export**
button will write the BOM to this file path. This path can contain [text
variables](#text-variables).

The settings on the left control how the BOM information is formatted in
the file. You can change the delimiter between fields, the delimiter
that surrounds each field, the delimiter that separates a sequence of
references (e.g. the comma in `R1,R3`), and the delimiter for a range of
references (e.g. the dash in `R1-R3`). If no range delimiter is given,
ranges will not be used: `R1-R3` will be written out as `R1,R2,R3`, for
example, assuming `,` as a reference delimiter. Tabs and newlines in
fields can be preserved or stripped, depending on the **Keep tabs** and
**Keep line breaks** settings.

Several default format presets are available. You can select a
comma-separated value (CSV) format, a tab-separated value (TSV) format,
or a semicolon-separated format. You can also create and save your own
presets. Custom presets can be deleted in this dialog or in the
[Schematic Setup](#schematic-setup) dialog.

### Legacy BOM generation

Previous versions of KiCad used external scripts to process the design
information into the desired output format. This BOM generation tool is
still available by selecting **Tools** → **Generate Legacy Bill of
Materials…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/dialog_bom.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="BOM dialog" />
</figure>

Several BOM generator scripts are included with KiCad, and users can
also create their own. BOM generator scripts generally use Python or
XSLT, but other tools can be used as long as you can specify a [command
line](#generator-command-line-format) for KiCad to execute when running
the generator.

You can select which BOM generator to use in the **BOM generator
scripts** list. The rest of the dialog displays information about the
selected generator. You can change the displayed name of the generator
with the **Generator nickname** textbox.

The pane at right displays information about the selected script. When
the generator is executed, the right pane instead displays output from
the script.

The text box at the bottom contains the command that KiCad will use to
execute the generator. It is automatically populated when a script is
selected, but the command may need to be hand-edited for some
generators. KiCad saves the command line for each generator when the BOM
tool is closed, so command line customizations are preserved. For more
details about the command line, see the [advanced
documentation](#generator-command-line-format).

On Windows, the BOM Generator dialog has an additional option **Show
console window**. When this option is unchecked, BOM generators run in a
hidden console window and any output is redirected and printed in the
dialog. When this option is checked, BOM generators run in a visible
console window, which may be necessary if the generator plugin provides
a graphical user interface.

#### BOM generator scripts

By default, the legacy BOM tool presents three output script options.

- `bom_csv_grouped_extra` outputs a CSV with a single section containing
  every component in the design. Components are grouped by value,
  footprint, DNP (do not populate), and any additional fields that are
  specified on the command line. To specify extra fields, add the
  desired field names as quoted strings at the end of the command line.
  For example, to include the `MPN` field, the end of the command line
  would be:
  `<path to script>/bom_csv_grouped_extra.py "%I" "%O.csv" "MPN"`. The
  columns in the BOM are:

  - Line item number

  - Reference designator(s)

  - Quantity

  - Value

  - Footprint

  - DNP

  - Specified extra fields

- `bom_csv_grouped_by_value` outputs a CSV with two sections. The first
  section contains every component in the design, with a single
  component on each line. The second section also contains every
  component, but components are grouped by symbol name, value,
  footprint, and DNP (do not populate). The columns in the BOM are:

  - Line item number

  - Quantity

  - Reference designator(s)

  - Value

  - Symbol library and symbol name

  - Footprint

  - Datasheet

  - DNP

  - Any other symbol fields

- `bom_csv_grouped_by_value_with_fp` outputs a CSV with a single section
  containing every component in the design. Components are grouped by
  value, footprint, and DNP (do not populate). The columns in the BOM
  are:

  - Reference designator(s)

  - Quantity

  - Value

  - Symbol name

  - Footprint

  - Symbol description

  - Vendor

  - DNP

Additional generator scripts are installed with KiCad but are not
populated in the generator script list by default. The location of these
scripts depends on the operating system and may vary based on
installation location.

| Operating System | Location                                                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows          | `C:\Program Files\KiCad\9.0\bin\scripting\plugins\`             |
| Linux            | `/usr/share/kicad/plugins/`                                     |
| macOS            | `/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/SharedSupport/plugins/` |

Additional scripts can be added to the list of BOM generator scripts by
clicking the ![Plus icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) button.
Scripts can be removed by clicking the ![Delete
icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button. The ![Edit
icon](images/icons/small_edit_16.png) button opens the selected script
in a text editor.

For more information on creating and using custom BOM generators, see
the [advanced documentation](#custom-netlist-and-bom-formats).

### BOM export from PCB editor

The PCB Editor can export a BOM through **File** → **Fabrication
Outputs** → **BOM…​**. This method provides no control over the output
format and does not include all symbol information, but is useful for
PCB-only workflows that do not involve a schematic. In general, it is
recommended to use the schematic editor’s BOM export tool instead.

## Generating a Netlist

A netlist is a file which describes electrical connections between
symbol pins. These connections are referred to as nets. Netlist files
contain:

- A list of symbols and their pins.

- A list of connections (nets) between symbol pins.

Many different netlist formats exist. Sometimes the symbols list and the
list of nets are two separate files. This netlist is fundamental in the
use of schematic capture software, because the netlist is the link with
other electronic CAD software, such as PCB layout software, simulators,
and programmable logic compilers.

KiCad supports several netlist formats:

- KiCad format, which can be imported by the KiCad PCB Editor. However,
  the ["Update PCB from Schematic"](#schematic-to-pcb) tool should be
  used instead of importing a KiCad netlist into the PCB editor.

- OrCAD PCB2 format, for designing PCBs with OrCAD.

- Allegro format, for designing PCBs with Allegro.

- PADS format, for designing PCBs with PADS.

- CADSTAR format, for designing PCBs with CADSTAR.

- Spice format, for use with various external circuit simulators.

<div class="note">

In KiCad version 5.0 and later, it is not necessary to create a netlist
for transferring a design from the schematic editor to the PCB editor.
Instead, use the ["Update PCB from Schematic"](#schematic-to-pcb) tool.

</div>

<div class="note">

Other software tools that use netlists may have restrictions on spaces
and special characters in component names, pins, nets, and other fields.
For compatibility, be aware of such restrictions in other tools you plan
to use, and name components, nets, etc. accordingly.

</div>

### Netlist formats

Netlists are exported with the Export Netlist dialog
(**File**→**Export**→**Netlist…​**).

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_netlist_dialog_kicad.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="KiCad netlist export" />
</figure>

KiCad supports exporting netlists in several formats: KiCad, OrcadPCB2,
Allegro, PADS, CADSTAR, Spice, and Spice Model. Each format can be
selected by selecting the corresponding tab at the top of the window.
Some netlist formats have additional options.

Clicking the **Export Netlist** button prompts for a netlist filename
and saves the netlist.

<div class="note">

Netlist generation can take up to several minutes for large schematics.

</div>

Custom generators for other netlist formats can be added by clicking the
**Add Generator…​** button. Custom generators are external tools that are
called by KiCad, for example Python scripts or XSLT stylesheets. For
more information on custom netlist generators, see [the section on
adding custom netlist generators](#custom-netlist-and-bom-formats).

#### Spice Netlist Format

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_netlist_dialog_spice.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Spice netlist export" />
</figure>

The Spice netlist format offers several options.

- When the **use current sheet as root** is selected, only the current
  sheet is exported to a subcircuit model. Otherwise, the entire
  schematic sheet is exported.

- The **Save all voltages** option adds a `.save all` command to the
  netlist, which causes the simulator to save all node voltages.

- The **Save all currents** option adds a `.probe alli` command to the
  netlist, which causes the simulator save all node currents.

- The **Save all power dissipations** adds `.probe` commands to save the
  power dissipation in each component.

- The **Save all digital event data** removes the `esave none` command
  from the netlist, which causes digital event data to be saved. Digital
  event data may consume a lot of memory.

<div class="note">

Exact behavior may vary between simulation tools.

</div>

Passive symbol values are automatically adjusted to be compatible with
various Spice simulators. Specifically:

- `μ` and `M` as unit prefixes are replaced with `u` and `Meg`,
  respectively

- Units are removed (e.g. `4.7kΩ` is changed to `4.7k`)

- Values in RKM format are rewritten to be Spice-compatible (e.g. `4u7`
  is changed to `4.7u`)

The Spice netlist exporter also provides an easy way to simulate the
generated netlist with an external simulator. This can be useful for
running a simulation without using [KiCad’s internal ngspice
simulator](#simulator), or for running an ngspice simulation with
options that are not supported by KiCad’s simulator tool.

Enter the path to the external simulator in the text box, with `%I`
representing the generated netlist. Check the **run external simulator
command** box to generate the netlist and automatically run the
simulator.

<div class="note">

The default simulator command (`spice "%I"`) must be adjusted to point
to a simulator installed on your system.

</div>

Spice simulators expect simulation commands (`.PROBE`, `.AC`, `.TRAN`,
etc.) to be included in the netlist. Any text line included in the
schematic diagram starting with a period (`.`) will be included in the
netlist. If a text object contains multiple lines, only the lines
beginning with a period will be included.

`.include` directives for including model library files are
automatically added to the netlist based on the Spice model settings for
the symbols in the schematic.

#### Spice Model Netlist Format

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_netlist_dialog_spice_model.png"
style="width:70.0%" alt="Spice netlist export" />
</figure>

KiCad can also export a netlist of the schematic as a Spice subcircuit
model, which can be included in a separate Spice simulation. Any
hierarchical labels in the schematic are used as pins for the subcircuit
model. Each pin in the model is annotated with a comment describing the
pin’s electrical direction:

- `Input` hierarchical labels are mapped to an `input` annotation

- `Output` hierarchical labels are mapped to an `output` annotation

- `Bidirectional` hierarchical labels are mapped to an `inout`
  annotation

- `Tri-state` hierarchical labels are mapped to a `tristate` annotation

- `Passive` hierarchical labels are mapped to a `passive` annotation

When the **use current sheet as root** is selected, only the current
sheet is exported to a subcircuit model. Otherwise, the entire schematic
sheet is exported.

# Symbols and Symbol Libraries

KiCad organizes symbols into symbol libraries, which hold collections of
symbols. Each symbol in a schematic is uniquely identified by a full
name that is composed of a library nickname and a symbol name. For
example, the identifier `Audio:AD1853` refers to the `AD1853` symbol in
the `Audio` library.

## Managing symbol libraries

KiCad uses a table of symbol libraries to map a symbol library nickname
to an underlying symbol library on disk. Kicad uses a global symbol
library table as well as a table specific to each project. To edit
either symbol library table, use **Preferences** → **Manage Symbol
Libraries…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/en/options_symbol_lib.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="sym lib table dlg" />
</figure>

The global symbol library table contains the list of libraries that are
always available regardless of the currently loaded project. The table
is saved in the file `sym-lib-table` in the KiCad configuration folder.
[The location of this folder](../kicad/kicad.xml#config-file-location)
depends on the operating system being used.

The project specific symbol library table contains the list of libraries
that are available specifically for the currently loaded project. If
there are any project-specific symbol libraries, the table is saved in
the file `sym-lib-table` in the project folder.

KiCad’s symbol library management system allows directly using many
types of symbol libraries, including formats that are native to other
non-KiCad EDA tools:

- KiCad symbol libraries (`.kicad_sym` files)

- KiCad Legacy symbol libraries (`.lib` files)

- Altium Designer libraries (`.SchLib` or `.IntLib` files)

- CADSTAR Schematic Archive libraries (`.lib` files)

- [KiCad database library configuration files](#database-libraries)
  (`.kicad_dbl` files)

- Eagle libraries (`.xml` files)

- EasyEDA (JLCEDA) Standard Edition libraries (`.json` files)

- EasyEDA (JLCEDA) Professional Edition libraries (`.elibz`, `.epro`, or
  `.zip` files)

- [KiCad HTTP library configuration files](#http-libraries)
  (`.kicad_httplib` files)

Non-KiCad symbol libraries, including KiCad Legacy symbol libraries, can
be migrated to KiCad `.kicad_sym` format using the **Migrate Libraries**
button (see the [migrating libraries](#migrating-symbol-libraries)
section).

<div class="note">

KiCad only supports writing to KiCad’s native `.kicad_sym` format symbol
libraries. All other symbol library formats are read-only. To modify a
non-KiCad format symbol library, you must first convert it to KiCad
format.

</div>

### Initial Configuration

The first time the KiCad Schematic Editor is run and the global symbol
table file `sym-lib-table` is not found in the KiCad configuration
folder, KiCad will guide the user through setting up a new symbol
library table. This process is described
[above](#initial-configuration). You can re-run this process at any time
by clicking the **Reset Libraries**.

<div class="warning">

Resetting your symbol library table will permanently change your symbol
library table on disk.

</div>

### Managing Table Entries

Symbol libraries can only be used if they have been added to either the
global or project-specific symbol library table.

Add a library either by clicking the ![Folder
icon](images/icons/small_folder_16.png) button and selecting a library
or clicking the ![Plus icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) button and
typing the path to a library file. The selected library will be added to
the currently opened library table (Global or Project Specific).
Libraries can be removed by selecting desired library entries and
clicking the ![Delete icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button.

The ![Up icon](images/icons/small_up_16.png) and ![Down
icon](images/icons/small_down_16.png) buttons move the selected library
up and down in the library table. This does not affect the display order
of libraries in the Symbol Editor or Symbol Chooser.

Libraries can be made inactive by unchecking the **Active** checkbox in
the first column. Inactive libraries are still in the library table but
do not appear in any library browsers and are not loaded from disk,
which can reduce loading times.

A range of libraries can be selected by clicking the first library in
the range and then Shift-clicking the last library in the range.

Each library must have a unique nickname: duplicate library nicknames
are not allowed in the same table. However, nicknames can be duplicated
between the global and project library tables. Libraries in the project
table take precedence over libraries with the same name in the global
table.

Library nicknames do not have to be related to the library filename or
path. The colon character (`:`) cannot be used in library nicknames or
symbol names because it is used as a separator between nicknames and
symbols.

Each library entry must have a valid path. Paths can be defined as
absolute, relative, or by [path variable
substitution](#sym-path-variable-substitution).

The appropriate library format must be selected in order for the library
to be properly read. The supported formats are listed above. Only KiCad
format libraries (`.kicad_sym`) can be saved. Other symbol library
formats are read-only and must be converted to KiCad format before you
can modify them.

There is an optional description field to add a description of the
library entry. The option field is not used at this time so adding
options will have no effect when loading libraries.

### Path Variable Substitution

The symbol library tables support path variable substitution, which
allows you to define path variables containing custom paths to where
your libraries are stored. Path variable substitution is supported by
using the syntax `${PATH_VAR_NAME}` in the symbol library path.

By default, KiCad defines several path variables which are described in
the [project manager
documentation](../kicad/kicad.xml#kicad-environment-variables). Path
variables can be configured in the **Preferences** → **Configure
Paths…​** dialog.

Using path variables in the symbol library tables allows libraries to be
relocated without breaking the symbol library tables, so long as the
path variables are updated when the library location changes.

<div class="note">

KiCad will automatically resolve versioned path variables from older
versions of KiCad to the value of the corresponding variable from the
current KiCad version, as long as the old variable is not explicitly
defined itself. For example, `${KICAD8_SYMBOL_DIR}` will automatically
resolve to the value of `${KICAD9_SYMBOL_DIR}` if there is no
`KICAD8_SYMBOL_DIR` variable defined.

</div>

`${KIPRJMOD}` is a special path variable that always expands to the
absolute path of the current project directory. `${KIPRJMOD}` allows
libraries to be stored in the project folder without having to use an
absolute path in the project library table. This makes it possible to
relocate projects without breaking their project library tables.

### Usage Patterns

Symbol libraries can be defined either globally or specifically to the
currently loaded project. Symbol libraries defined in the user’s global
table are always available and are stored in the `sym-lib-table` file in
the user’s KiCad configuration folder. The project-specific symbol
library table is active only for the currently open project file.

There are advantages and disadvantages to each method. Defining all
libraries in the global table means they will always be available when
needed. The disadvantage of this is that load time will increase.

Defining all symbol libraries on a project specific basis means that you
only have the libraries required for the project which decreases symbol
library load times. The disadvantage is that you always have to remember
to add each symbol library that you need for every project.

One usage pattern would be to define commonly used libraries globally
and the libraries only required for the project in the project specific
library table. There is no restriction on how to define libraries.

### Migrating symbol libraries to KiCad format

Non-KiCad format libraries, including legacy libraries (`.lib` files),
are read-only. They need to be converted to KiCad format (`.kicad_sym`
files) before you can save changes to them.

<div class="note">

As with most KiCad files, newer versions of KiCad can open older-format
library files, but older versions of KiCad cannot read files once they
have been saved by a newer version of KiCad.

</div>

Libraries in other formats can be converted to KiCad libraries by
selecting them in the symbol library table and clicking the **Migrate
Libraries** button. Multiple libraries can be selected and migrated at
once by Ctrl-clicking or shift-clicking.

Libraries can also be converted one at a time by opening them in the
Symbol Editor and saving them as a new library.

### Legacy Project Remapping

When loading a schematic created prior to the symbol library table
implementation, KiCad will attempt to remap the symbol library links in
the schematic to the appropriate library table symbols. The success of
this process is dependent on several factors:

- the original libraries used in the schematic are still available and
  unchanged from when the symbol was added to the schematic.

- all rescue operations were performed when detected to create a rescue
  library or keep the existing rescue library up to date.

- the integrity of the project symbol cache library has not been
  corrupted.

<div class="warning">

The remapping will make a back up of all the files that are changed
during remapping in the rescue-backup folder in the project folder.
Always make a back up of your project before remapping just in case
something goes wrong.

</div>

<div class="warning">

The rescue operation is performed even if it has been disabled to ensure
the correct symbols are available for remapping. Do not cancel this
operation or the remapping will fail to correctly remap schematics
symbols. Any broken symbol links will have to be fixed manually.

</div>

<div class="note">

If the original libraries have been removed and the rescue was not
performed, the cache library can be used as a recovery library as a last
resort. Copy the cache library to a new file name and add the new
library file to the top of the library list using a version of KiCad
prior to the symbol library table implementation.

</div>

## Creating and editing symbols

A symbol is a schematic representation of a component. A symbol is
composed of:

- Graphical items (lines, circles, arcs, text, etc.) that determine how
  symbol looks in a schematic.

- Pins, which have both graphic properties (line, clock, inverted, low
  level active, etc.) and electrical properties (input, output,
  bidirectional, etc.) used by the Electrical Rules Check (ERC) tool.

- Fields, such as references, values, corresponding footprint names for
  PCB design, etc.

A symbol library is composed of one or more symbols. Generally the
symbols are logically grouped by function, type, and/or manufacturer.
Each symbol library is a single file with the `.kicad_sym` extension.

Symbols can be derived from another symbol in the same library. Derived
symbols share the base symbol’s graphical shape and pin definitions, but
can override the base symbol’s property fields (value, footprint,
footprint filters, datasheet, description, etc.). Derived symbols can be
used to define symbols that are similar to a base part. For example,
74LS00, 74HC00, and 7437 symbols could all be derived from a 7400
symbol. In previous versions of KiCad, derived symbols were referred to
as aliases.

### Symbol Editor overview

KiCad provides a symbol editing tool that allows you to create
libraries; add, edit, delete, or transfer symbols between libraries;
export symbols to files; and import symbols from files. The Symbol
Editor can be launched from the KiCad Project Manager or from the
Schematic Editor (**Tools** → **Symbol Editor**). You can also open the
Symbol Editor from the [a symbol in the
schematic](#editing-symbol-properties); in this way you can edit either
the library copy or the schematic copy of that symbol in the editor.

<div class="note">

Editing the library version of a symbol will not affect any copies of
that symbol that have been added to a schematic until the schematic copy
is updated from the library. Conversely, editing the schematic version
of a symbol will not affect the library version of a symbol or any other
copies of that symbol in a schematic.

</div>

In general, the flow for designing a symbol involves:

- Defining if the symbol is made up of one or more units.

- Defining if the symbol has an alternate body style (also known as a De
  Morgan representation).

- Designing its symbolic representation using lines, rectangles,
  circles, polygons and text.

- Adding pins by carefully defining each pin’s graphical elements, name,
  number, and electrical property (input, output, tri-state, power
  output, etc.).

- Determining if the symbol should be derived from another symbol with
  the same graphical design and pin definition.

- Adding optional fields such as the name of the footprint used by the
  PCB design software and/or defining their visibility.

- Documenting the symbol by adding a description string and links to
  data sheets, etc.

- Saving it in the desired library.

The Symbol Editor main window is shown below. It has three toolbars for
quick access to common features and a symbol viewing/editing canvas. Not
all commands are available on the toolbars, but all commands are
available in the menus.

In addition to the toolbars, there are collapsible panels for the symbol
tree, Properties Manager, and selection filter on the left. The bottom
of the window contains a message panel that shows details about the
selected object.

#### Top toolbar

The main toolbar is at the top of the main window. It has buttons for
the undo/redo commands, zoom commands, symbol properties dialogs, and
unit/representation management controls.

### Browsing, modifying, and saving symbols

The ![Symbol tree icon](images/icons/search_tree_24.png) button displays
or hides the list of available libraries, which allows you to select an
active library. When a new symbol is created, it will be placed in the
active library.

Clicking on a symbol name opens that symbol in the editor, and hovering
the cursor over the name of a symbol displays a preview of the symbol.

<div class="note">

Some symbols are derived from other symbols. Derived symbol names are
displayed in *italics* in the treeview. If a derived symbol is opened,
its symbol graphics will not be editable. Its symbol fields will be
editable as normal. To edit the graphics of a base symbol and all of its
derived symbols, open the base symbol.

</div>

After modification, a symbol can be saved in the current library or a
different library. To save the modified symbol in the current library,
click the ![Save icon](images/icons/save_24.png) icon.

<div class="note">

Saving a modified symbol also saves all other modified symbols in the
same library.

</div>

To save the symbol changes to a new symbol, click **File** → **Save
As…​**. The symbol can be saved in the current library or a different
library (including a new library), and a new name can be set for the
symbol. Alternatively, you can use **File** → **Save Copy As…​**, which
behaves the same as **Save As** except that the original symbol remains
open rather than switching to the new symbol.

To create a new file containing only the current symbol, click **File**
→ **Export** → **Symbol…​**. This file will be a standard symbol library
file which will contain only one symbol. The library will not be added
to your library table.

The editor can also open symbols from the schematic. To edit a symbol
from the schematic, right click a symbol in the Schematic Editor and
select **Open in Schematic Editor**
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+E</span>).

Editing and saving the schematic copy of a symbol will only update that
symbol in the schematic; it will not update other copies of that symbol
in the schematic, and it will not change the original library copy of
the symbol. When you open the schematic copy of a symbol, the Schematic
Editor displays an info bar that warns you the library copy will not be
modified. You can click the link in this info bar to open the library
version of the symbol instead, or press
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+E</span>.

### Creating a new symbol library

You can create a new symbol library by clicking **File** → **New
Library…​**. At this point you must choose whether the new library should
be added to the global symbol library table or the project symbol
library table. Libraries in the global library table will be available
to all projects, while libraries in the project library table will only
be available in the current project.

<figure>
<img src="images/symbol_editor_new_library.png"
alt="symbol editor new library" />
</figure>

Following selection of the library table, you must choose a name and
location for the new library. A new, empty library will be created at
the specified location.

### Creating a new symbol

To create a new symbol in the current symbol library, click the ![New
symbol icon](images/icons/new_component_24.png) button. You will be
asked for a number of symbol properties.

- A symbol name

- An optional base symbol to derive the new symbol from. The new symbol
  will use the base symbol’s graphical shape and pin configuration, but
  other symbol information can be modified in the derived symbol. The
  base symbol must be in the same library as the new derived symbol.

- The reference designator prefix (`U`, `C`, `R`…​).

- The number of units per package, and whether those units are
  interchangeable (for example a 7400 quad NAND symbol could have 4
  units, one for each gate).

- If an alternate body style (sometimes referred to as a "De Morgan
  equivalent") is desired.

- Whether the symbol is a power symbol. Power symbols appear in the
  **Add Power Symbol** dialog in the Schematic editor, make global net
  connections based on their value, cannot be assigned a footprint, and
  are excluded from the PCB and bill of materials.

- Whether the symbol should be excluded from the bill of materials.

- Whether the symbol should be excluded from the PCB.

There are also several graphical options.

- The offset between the end of each pin and its pin name.

- Whether the pin number and pin name should be displayed.

- Whether the pin names should be displayed alongside the pins or at the
  ends of the pins inside the symbol body.

These properties can also be changed later in the [Symbol Properties
window](#symbol-properties).

</figure>

A new symbol will be created using the properties above and will appear
in the editor as shown below.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_new.png" style="width:95.0%"
alt="Newly created symbol" />
</figure>

The blue cross in the center is the symbol anchor, which specifies the
symbol origin i.e. the coordinates (0, 0). The anchor can be
repositioned by selecting the ![Anchor icon](images/icons/anchor_24.png)
button and clicking on the new desired anchor position.

### Editing Symbol Properties

Symbol properties are set when the symbol is created but they can be
modified at any point. To change the symbol properties, click on the
![Symbol properties icon](images/icons/part_properties_24.png) button to
show the Symbol Properties dialog. You can also double click an empty
spot in the editing canvas.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_properties_for_symbol.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="Symbol Properties" />
</figure>

It is important to set the **number of units** and check **all units are
interchangeable** and **has alternate body style**, as applicable,
because these settings affect how pins and graphics are added to each
symbol unit.

If you change the number of units per package after adding the pins to
the symbol, you will need to do extra work to add pins and graphics for
the additional units. The pins and graphics would have been
automatically added to each unit had these properties been correctly set
initially. Nevertheless, it is possible to modify these properties at
any time.

The graphic options **Show pin number** and **Show pin name** define the
visibility of the pin number and pin name text. The option **Place pin
names inside** defines the pin name position relative to the pin body.
The pin names will be displayed inside the symbol outline if the option
is checked. In this case the **Pin Name Position Offset** property
defines the shift of the text away from the body end of the pin. A value
from `0.02` to `0.05` inches is usually reasonable.

The example below shows a symbol with the **Place pin name inside**
option unchecked. Notice the position of the names and pin numbers.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_uncheck_pin_name_inside.png"
style="width:95.0%" alt="Place pin name inside unchecked" />
</figure>

#### Symbol Name and Keywords

**Symbol name** is the symbol’s name in the library. Symbols are
identified by a combination of the library and symbol name.

In previous versions of KiCad, the symbol name was linked to the `Value`
field. This link is removed in KiCad 7.0 and later.

The **keywords** should contain additional terms related to the
component. Keywords are primarily used, in combination with the symbol
name and the `Description` field, for searching for the symbol in the
Symbol Chooser and the Symbol Editor. Those three items are also
displayed when you select a symbol in the Symbol Chooser.

### Symbol Fields

Symbols contain multiple fields, which are named values containing
information related to the symbol. Fields can be displayed on the
schematic or hidden and only shown in the symbol’s properties. Some
fields have special meaning to KiCad: `Reference` and `Footprint` are
both critical for creating a PCB, for example. Other fields may contain
information that is important for a design but is not interpreted by
KiCad, like pricing or stock information for a part.

Any fields defined in a library symbol will be included in the symbol
when it is added to a schematic. You can also add new fields to symbols
in the schematic. Whether they are in the library symbol or not, these
fields can then be edited on a per-symbol basis in the schematic. They
are also transferred to the symbol’s corresponding footprint in the PCB.

<div class="note">

Symbol fields are different than graphic text. In addition to being
named, fields can be moved and edited in the schematic, while symbol
text can only be edited in the symbol editor.

</div>

All library symbols are defined with five default fields: `Reference`,
`Value`, `Footprint`, `Datasheet`, and `Description`, which are added
whenever a symbol is created. These default fields cannot be deleted.
Only the `Reference` field is required to have a value: the contents of
a library symbol’s `Reference` field is used as the reference designator
prefix when the symbol is added to a schematic. In the schematic, the
symbol’s `Reference` field contains the entire reference designator.

The `Footprint` field, if used, contains a reference to a footprint for
the symbol. The format is `LIBNAME:FOOTPRINTNAME`, where `LIBNAME` is
the name of the footprint library in the footprint library table (see
the [Footprint Library
Table](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#managing-footprint-libraries) section in the
PCB Editor manual) and `FOOTPRINTNAME` is the name of the footprint in
the library `LIBNAME`.

The `Description` field can contain text describing the symbol such as
the component function, distinguishing features, and package options.
Together with the symbol’s name and keywords, text in this field is used
when searching for symbols in the Symbol Chooser or Symbol Editor.
Before KiCad version 8.0, this was a dedicated property (like the symbol
name and keywords) rather than a symbol field.

Symbols defined in libraries are typically defined with only these five
default fields. Additional fields such as vendor, part number, unit
cost, etc. can be added to library symbols but generally this is done in
the schematic editor so the additional fields can be added to every
symbol in the schematic, not just all symbols of one type.

<div class="note">

A convenient way to create additional empty symbol fields is to use
define field name templates. Field name templates define empty fields
that are added to each symbol when it is inserted into the schematic.
Field name templates can be defined globally (for all schematics) in the
Schematic Editor Preferences, or they can be defined locally (specific
to each project) in the Schematic Setup dialog.

</div>

<div class="note">

If you want to manage a large amount of component data in symbol fields,
consider using [database libraries](#database-libraries).

</div>

To edit an existing symbol field, double-click the field, select it or
hover and press E, or right-click on the field text and select
**Properties…​**.

To add new fields, delete optional fields, or edit existing fields, use
the ![Component properties icon](images/icons/part_properties_24.png)
icon on the main tool bar to open the [Symbol Properties
dialog](#symbol-properties). Fields can be arbitrarily named, but names
starting with `ki_`, e.g. `ki_description`, are reserved by KiCad and
should not be used for user fields.

Fields have a number of properties, each of which is shown as a column
in the properties grid. Not all columns are shown by default; columns
can be shown or hidden by right clicking on the grid header and
selecting or deselecting columns from the menu.

### Footprint Filters

The footprint filters tab is used to define which footprints are
appropriate to use with the symbol. The filters can be applied in the
Footprint Assignment tool so that only appropriate footprints are
displayed for each symbol.

Multiple footprint filters can be defined. Footprints that match any of
the filters will be displayed; if no filters are defined, then all
footprints will be displayed.

Filters can use wildcards: `*` matches any number of characters,
including zero, and `?` matches zero or one characters. For example,
`SOIC-*` would match the `SOIC-8_3.9x4.9mm_P1.27mm` footprint as well as
any other footprint beginning with `SOIC-`. The filter `SOT?23` matches
`SOT23` as well as `SOT-23`.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_footprint.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Footprint filters" />
</figure>

### Embedding files

External files can be embedded within a symbol. Embedding a file stores
a copy of the file inside the symbol. The symbol can then refer to the
embedded copy of the file instead of the external file, which makes the
symbol more portable as it doesn’t rely on an external file, although
the symbol library’s filesize is increased as a result. In symbols this
is especially useful for embedding datasheets and [SPICE
models](#sim-library). Files embedded in a symbol are deduplicated when
the symbol is added to a schematic: if a file is embedded in a symbol,
and multiple instances of that symbol are added to the schematic, only
one copy of the file will be embedded, and all of the schematic
instances will refer to the same embedded file. Files embedded in a
schematic cannot be referred to in the parent schematic. File embedding
is explained in more detail in the [Schematic Setup
documentation](#sch-embedding-files).

<figure>
<img src="images/sym_embedded_files.png" alt="sym embedded files" />
</figure>

<div class="note">

You can add a datasheet, or a SPICE model, to a symbol and embed it in
one step. To do so, browse for a datasheet (in the Symbol Properties
dialog) or a SPICE model (in the SPICE Model Editor) and enable the
**Embed File** checkbox in the file browser while choosing a file. This
embeds the file and automatically uses the embedded reference as the
file path instead of the path to the external file.

</div>

### Symbol Units and Alternate Body Styles

Symbols can have more than one unit per package, each with different
graphics and pin configurations. This is often used for logic gates,
opamps, or other components that have multiple subunits within one
physical package. Symbols can also have up to two body styles, a
standard symbol and an alternate symbol often referred to as a "De
Morgan equivalent".

For example, consider a relay with two switches, which can be designed
as a symbol with one body style and three different units: a coil,
switch 1, and switch 2. Designing a symbol with multiple units per
package and/or alternate body styles is very flexible. A pin or a body
symbol item can be common to all units or specific to a given unit or
they can be common to both symbolic representation so are specific to a
given symbol representation.

By default, pins are specific to a unit and body style. When a pin is
common to all units or all body styles, it only needs to be created
once, no mattery how many units or body styles are used. This is also
the case for the body style graphic shapes and text, which may be common
to each unit, but typically are specific to each body style.

To add additional units to a symbol, set the **Number of Units**
property to the appropriate number in the Symbol Properties dialog. By
default, symbol units are named `Unit A`, `Unit B`, etc., but you can
set an arbitrary name for the current unit using **Edit** → **Set Unit
Display Name…​**.

Use the ![unit selection
dropdown](images/symbol_editor_unit_selector.png) unit selection
dropdown to select the unit you wish to edit.

To add an alternate body style, set the **Has alternate body style (De
Morgan)** property in the Symbol Properties dialog.

If the symbol has an alternate body style defined, one body style must
be selected for editing at a time. To edit the normal representation,
click the ![Normal representation icon](images/icons/morgan1_24.png)
icon. To edit the alternate representation, click on the ![Alternate
representation icon](images/icons/morgan2_24.png) icon.

<div class="note">

**Synchronized Pins Edit Mode** can be enabled by clicking the
![Synchronized pins edit mode icon](images/icons/pin2pin_24.png) icon.
In this mode, pin modifications are propagated between symbol units;
changes made in one unit will be reflected in the other units as well.
When this mode is disabled, pin changes made in one unit do not affect
other units. This mode is enabled automatically when **All units are
interchangeable** is checked, but it can be disabled. The mode cannot be
enabled when **All units are interchangeable** is unchecked or when the
symbol only has one unit.

</div>

#### Example of a Symbol With Multiple Noninterchangeable Units

For an example of a symbol with multiple units that are not
interchangeable, consider a relay with 3 units per package: a coil,
switch 1, and switch 2.

The three units are not all the same, so **All units are
interchangeable** should be deselected in the Symbol Properties dialog.
Alternatively, this option could have been specified when the symbol was
initially created.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_not_interchangeable.png"
style="width:60.0%" alt="Uncheck all units are interchangeable" />
</figure>

##### Unit A

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_unit1.png" style="width:45.0%"
alt="Relay unit A" />
</figure>

##### Unit B

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_unit2.png" style="width:45.0%"
alt="Relay unit B" />
</figure>

##### Unit C

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_unit3.png" style="width:45.0%"
alt="Relay unit C" />
</figure>

Unit A does not have the same symbol and pin layout as Units B and C, so
the units are not interchangeable.

### Symbol Graphics

Graphical elements create the visual representation of a symbol and
contain no electrical connection information. You can draw new graphic
shapes using the buttons on the right toolbar. The following types of
objects are available:

- Lines (![line icon](images/icons/add_graphical_segments_24.png)) and
  polygons (![polygon icon](images/icons/add_graphical_polygon_24.png))
  defined by start and end points.

- Rectangles (![rectangle icon](images/icons/add_rectangle_24.png))
  defined by two diagonal corners.

- Circles (![circle icon](images/icons/add_circle_24.png)) defined by
  the center and radius.

- Arcs (![arc icon](images/icons/add_arc_24.png)) defined by the
  starting and ending point of the arc and its center.

- Graphical text (![Text icon](images/icons/text_24.png)) and textboxes
  (![textbox icon](images/icons/add_textbox_24.png)), which is
  automatically oriented to be readable, even when the symbol is
  mirrored. Note that graphic text items are not the same as symbol
  fields.

Each graphic item (line, arc, circle, etc.) can be defined as common to
all units and/or body styles or specific to a given unit and/or body
style.

Element options can be quickly accessed by right-clicking on the element
to display the context menu for the selected element. You can also
double-left-click on an element to modify its properties, or edit its
properties using the Properties Manager panel.

Below is the properties dialog for a polygon element.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_polyline_properties.png"
style="width:50.0%" alt="Graphic line properties" />
</figure>

The properties of a graphic element are:

- **Border** determines whether the the shape’s outline should be drawn.

- **Width** and **color** define the line width and color of the border.
  A border width of `0` uses the schematic’s default symbol line width.
  **Style** determines the line style of the border (solid, dashed,
  dotted, etc.).

- **Fill Style** determines if the shape defined by the graphical
  element is to be drawn unfilled or filled. The fill color can be the
  color theme’s body outline color, body background color, or a custom
  color.

- **Common to all units in symbol** determines if the graphical element
  is drawn for each unit in symbol with more than one unit per package
  or if the graphical element is only drawn for the current unit.

- **Common to all body styles (De Morgan)** determines if the graphical
  element is drawn for each symbolic representation in symbols with an
  alternate body style or if the graphical element is only drawn for the
  current body style.

- **Private to Symbol Editor** causes the shape to be visible only when
  the symbol is edited in the Symbol Editor. The shape will be hidden
  when the symbol is added to a schematic.

### Symbol Pins

You can create and insert a pin by clicking on the ![Pin
icon](images/icons/pin_24.png) button. Pin properties can be edited by
double clicking on the pin. You can also delete or move pins that you
have already added. Pins must be created carefully, because any error
will have consequences on the PCB design.

A pin is defined by its graphical representation, its name, and its
number. The pin’s name and number can contain letters, numbers, and
symbols, but not spaces. For the Electrical Rules Check (ERC) tool to be
useful, the pin’s electrical type (input, output, tri-state…​) must also
be defined correctly. If this type is not defined properly, the
schematic ERC check results may be invalid.

Important notes:

- Symbol pins are matched to footprint pads by number. The pin number in
  the symbol must match the corresponding pad number in the footprint.

- Do not use spaces in pin names and numbers. Spaces will be
  automatically replaced with underscores (`_`).

- To define a pin name with an inverted signal (overbar) use the `~`
  (tilde) character followed by the text to invert in braces. For
  example `~{FO}O` would display <span class="overline">FO</span> O.

- If the pin name is empty, the pin is considered unnamed.

- Pin names can be repeated in a symbol.

- Pin numbers must be unique in a symbol.

#### Pin Properties

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_pin_properties.png"
style="width:95.0%" alt="Pin properties" />
</figure>

The pin properties dialog allows you to edit all of the characteristics
of a pin. This dialog pops up automatically when you create a pin or
when double-clicking on an existing pin. This dialog allows you to
modify:

- The pin name and text size.

- The pin number and text size.

- The pin length.

- The pin electrical type and graphical style.

- Unit and alternate representation membership.

- Pin visibility.

- [Alternate pin definitions](#alternate-pin-definitions).

#### Pin Graphic Styles

The different pin graphic styles are shown in the figure below. These
styles are purely graphical and do not affect the pin’s electrical type.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_pin_properties_style.png"
style="width:95.0%" alt="Pin graphic styles" />
</figure>

#### Pin Electrical Types

Each pin in a symbol has an electrical type, such as input, output, or
tri-state.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_pin_properties_type.png"
style="width:95.0%" alt="Pin graphic styles" />
</figure>

Choosing the correct electrical type is important for the schematic ERC
tool. ERC will check that pins are connected appropriately, for example
ensuring that input pins are driven and power inputs receive power from
an appropriate source.

You can use the **Pin Conflicts Map** in the schematic editor to
configure which pin types are allowed to connect and which will
conflict. The default Pin Conflicts settings are briefly explained
below. For more information, see the [ERC documentation](#erc).

Additionally, some pin types have special behavior outside of ERC. In
the router, pads corresponding to a **free** pin can be connected to
copper of any other net without causing a DRC error, and multiple pads
corresponding to a single **unconnected** pin do not need to be
connected to each other in the board.

<div class="note">

The pin type that produces the optimal ERC pin conflict checking
behavior is not always the same as the pin’s conceptual pin type. When
selecting a pin type, you should consider how that type will interact
with the pin type of other connected pins and whether that will result
in the desired ERC behavior. An example is an analog control pin that
generates a current and senses the voltage generated by that current
flowing through an external resistor. This pin could be considered an
input pin because it senses a voltage provided externally. However, in a
schematic this pin will be connected to a resistor pin (passive) and not
to an output pin. There shouldn’t be an ERC violation if the pin isn’t
connected to an output pin; in fact, there should be an ERC violation if
the pin *does* connect to another output pin, as the pin would be
sourcing a current on a net that is already driven. Therefore such a pin
should have the Output pin type even though it is sensing a voltage and
could be considered an input.

#### Pushing Pin Properties to Other Pins

You can apply the length, name size, or number size of a pin to the
other pins in the symbol by right clicking the pin and selecting **Push
Pin Length**, **Push Pin Name Size**, or **Push Pin Number Size**,
respectively. All other pins in the symbol will be updated.

#### Defining Pins for Multiple Units and Alternate Symbolic Representations

Symbols with multiple units and/or graphical representations are
particularly problematic when creating and editing pins. Most commonly,
pins are specific to each symbol unit (because each unit has a different
set of pins) and to each body style (because the form and position is
different between the normal body style and the alternate form).

The symbol library editor allows the simultaneous creation of pins. By
default, changes made to a pin are made for all units of a multiple unit
symbol and to both representations for symbols with an alternate
symbolic representation. The only exception to this is the pin’s
graphical type and name, which remain unlinked between symbol units and
body styles. This dependency was established to allow for easier pin
creation and editing in most cases. This dependency can be disabled by
toggling the ![Synchronized pin edit mode
icon](images/icons/pin2pin_24.png) icon on the main tool bar. This will
allow you to create pins for each unit and representation completely
independently.

Pins can be common or specific to different units. Pins can also be
common to both symbolic representations or specific to each symbolic
representation. When a pin is common to all units, it only has to drawn
once. Pins are set as common or specific in the pin properties dialog.

An example is the output pin in the 7400 quad dual input NAND gate.
Since there are four units and two symbolic representations, there are
eight separate output pins defined in the symbol definition. When
creating a new 7400 symbol, unit A of the normal symbolic representation
will be shown in the library editor. To edit the pin style in the
alternate symbolic representation, it must first be enabled by clicking
the ![Alternate representation icon](images/icons/morgan2_24.png) button
on the tool bar. To edit the pin number for each unit, select the
appropriate unit using the ![unit selection
dropdown](images/symbol_editor_unit_selector.png) drop down control.

#### Pin Table

Another way to edit pins is to use the Pin Table, which is accessible
via the ![Pin table icon](images/icons/pin_table_24.png) icon. The Pin
Table displays all of the pins in the symbol and their properties in a
table view, so it is useful for making bulk pin changes.

Any pin property can be edited by clicking on the appropriate cell. Pins
can be added and removed with the ![Plus
icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) and ![Trash
icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) icons, respectively.

You can edit the same property for multiple pins simultaneously by
grouping pins. Pins can be automatically grouped by name, or you
manually group several pins by selecting them and clicking **Group
Selected**. Click the ![small refresh
16](images/icons/small_refresh_16.png) button to clear the manual
grouping. You can also filter the table to only display pins in certain
units.

<div class="note">

Columns of the pin table can be shown or hidden by right-clicking on the
header row and checking or unchecking additional columns. Some columns
are hidden by default.

</div>

The screenshot below shows the pin table for a dual opamp.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_pin_table.png" style="width:95.0%"
alt="Pin table" />
</figure>

#### Alternate Pin Function Definitions

Symbol pins can have alternate pin functions defined for them. Alternate
pin functions allow you to select a different name, electrical type, and
graphical style for a pin when a symbol has been placed in the
schematic. This can be used for pins that have multiple functions, such
as microcontroller pins.

Alternate pin functions are added in the Pin Properties dialog as shown
below. Each alternate definition contains a pin name, electrical type,
and graphic style. This microcontroller pin has all of its peripheral
functions defined in the symbol as alternate pin names.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_alternate_pin_definitions.png"
style="width:60.0%" alt="Alternate pin definitions" />
</figure>

Alternate pin functions are selected in the Schematic Editor once the
symbol has been placed in the schematic. For information on using
alternate pin functions in the schematic, see the [schematic editor
symbol documentation](#alternate-pin-functions).

### Creating Power Symbols

Power symbols are symbols that are used to label a wire as part of a
global power net, like `VCC` or `GND`. The power symbol’s `Value` field
determines the net label. The behavior of power symbols is described in
the [electrical connections section](#power-symbols). Power symbols are
handled and created the same way as normal symbols, but there are
several additional considerations described below.

It may be useful to place power symbols in a dedicated library. KiCad’s
symbol library places power symbols in the `power` library, and users
may create libraries to store their own power symbols. If the **Define
as power symbol** box is checked in a symbol’s properties, that symbol
will appear in the Schematic Editor’s **Add Power Symbol** dialog for
convenient access.

Power symbols consist of a single pin of type Power Input. They must
also have the **Define as power symbol** property checked.

<div class="note">

In previous versions of KiCad, a power symbol’s pin needed to be both a
power input pin and invisible, and the pin’s name determined the name of
the net that the power symbol connected with. Beginning in KiCad version
8, the pin in a power symbol does not need to be invisible, and the net
is determined by the power symbol’s `Value` field.

</div>

Below is an example of a `GND` power symbol.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_power_symbol.png" style="width:95.0%"
alt="Editing a power symbol" />
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_libedit_power_symbol_pin.png"
style="width:60.0%" alt="Power symbol pin" />
</figure>

To create a power symbol, use the following steps:

- Add a pin of type **Power input**. Make the pin number `1`, the length
  `0`, set the graphic style to **Line**, and make the pin **visible**.
  The pin number, name, length, and line style do not matter
  electrically.

- Place the pin on the symbol anchor. This is not required but makes it
  easier to place the power symbol in the schematic.

- Use the shape tools to draw the symbol graphics.

- Set the symbol value to the desired net name. The symbol value is
  electrically important: it determines the symbol’s connected net name.
  This field can be changed later, after the symbol has been placed in
  the schematic, which will change which net the symbol connects to.

- Check the **Define as power symbol** box in Symbol Properties window.
  This makes the symbol appear in the **Add Power Symbol** dialog,
  prevents the symbol from being assigned a footprint, and excludes the
  symbol from the board, BOM, and netlists.

- Also deselect the **Show pin number** and **Show pin name** options in
  the Symbol Properties window. This is not necessary but improves the
  symbol’s appearance.

- Set the symbol reference and uncheck the **Show** box. The reference
  text is not important except for the first character, which should be
  `#`. For the power symbol shown above, the reference could be `#GND`.
  Symbols with references that begin with `#` are not added to the PCB,
  are not included in Bill of Materials exports or netlists, and they
  cannot be assigned a footprint in the footprint assignment tool. If a
  power symbol’s reference does not begin with `#`, the character will
  be inserted automatically when the annotation or footprint assignment
  tools are run.

An easier method to [create a new power symbol is to use another symbol
as a starting point](#creating-a-symbol-from-another-symbol).

### Checking Symbols

The Symbol Editor can check for common issues in your symbols. Run the
symbol checker using the ![symbol checker icon](images/icons/erc_24.png)
button in the top toolbar.

<figure>
<img src="images/symbol_checker.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="symbol checker detecting an off-grid pin" />
</figure>

The symbol checker checks for:

- Pins that are off-grid (pins are considered off grid if their position
  is not a multiple of the current symbol editor grid. It is strongly
  recommended to use a 50 mil grid for symbol pins)

- Pins that are duplicated

- Issues with graphical shapes, such as zero-sized shapes

- Illegal reference designator prefixes: reference designator prefixes
  should not end with a number or `?`

- Incorrectly designed [power symbols](#power-symbols). Power symbols
  should have:

  - A single unit

  - No alternate body styles

  - A single pin which is either of type Power Output (see
    [PWR_FLAG](#pwr-flag)) or visible and of type Power Input (see
    [power symbols](#power-symbols))

- [Hidden Power Input pins](#hidden-power-pins) in non-power symbols:
  these create implicit connections and are not recommended

<div class="note">

In previous versions of KiCad, [power symbols](#creating-power-symbols)
required an invisible power input pin so that they would make a global
connection. In KiCad 8, the power input pin does not need to be
invisible. Therefore the symbol checker will report if invisible power
input pins are detected.

</div>

## Browsing symbol libraries

The Symbol Library Browser allows you to quickly examine the contents of
symbol libraries. The Symbol Library Viewer can be accessed by clicking
![Library viewer icon](images/icons/library_browser_24.png) icon on the
main Symbol Editor toolbar or with **View** → **Symbol Library
Browser**.

To examine the contents of a library, select a library from the list in
the left hand panel. All symbols in the selected library will appear in
the second panel. Select a symbol name to view the symbol.

<figure>
<img src="images/symbol_library_browser.png" style="width:95.0%"
alt="Symbol Library Browser" />
</figure>

Double clicking the name of a symbol or using the ![Add symbol to
schematic icon](images/icons/add_symbol_to_schematic_24.png) button adds
the symbol to the schematic.

The top toolbar contains the following commands:

|                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                 |

# Schematic design blocks

Schematic design blocks allow you to save a portion of a schematic and
reuse it later. You can reuse design blocks within the same schematic or
in different schematics. Design blocks are saved and organized in design
block libraries, much like symbols and footprints. When you use a design
block, the saved schematic fragment is inserted into the current
schematic, either in the current sheet or in a new subsheet.

To use schematic design blocks, first show the Design Blocks panel by
clicking **View** → **Panels** → **Design Blocks**. This opens a docked
panel on the right side of the schematic editor. To close the panel, use
the same menu entry or right click in the panel and choose **Hide
Library Tree**.

<figure>
<img src="images/design_block_panel.png" alt="design block panel" />
</figure>

## Using design blocks in a schematic

The Design Blocks panel contains a library tree that lists your design
block libraries and the design blocks contained in each library. Each
library can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the design blocks
in that library. There is a **Recently Used** pseudo-library at the top
of the tree that contains any design blocks that you have recently
placed. You can pin any libraries to the top of the list by right
clicking the library and selecting **Pin Library**.

You can filter design blocks by their name, description, and keywords
using the filter textbox at the top of the Design Blocks panel. By
default, matches are sorted by best match, but you can change to sorting
alphabetically using the ![small sort desc
16](images/icons/small_sort_desc_16.png) button.

When you select a design block in the library tree, the design block’s
name and metadata are displayed below the library tree along with a
graphical preview of the design block. The metadata includes the block’s
description and keywords.

To add a design block to the schematic, double click it in the library
tree or right click a design block and select **Place Design Block**.

If the **Place as sheet** checkbox is enabled, you will need to click
twice in the editing canvas to place two corners of a [hierarchical
sheet](#hierarchical-sheets). The design block contents will be placed
in the new sheet. If the **Place as sheet** checkbox is not enabled,
clicking once in the canvas will place the contents of the design block
directly into the current schematic.

If the **Place repeated copies** checkbox is enabled, KiCad will begin
placing the design block again when you finish placing the previous
block. To cancel placing the next block, press Esc or right click and
select **Cancel**.

If the **Keep annotations** checkbox is enabled, KiCad will insert the
design block without changing the symbol annotations as defined in the
saved design block. If it is not enabled, KiCad will reset the symbol
annotations while inserting the design block and reannotate all of the
symbols in the block according to the current annotation settings.

Once placed in a schematic, the contents of a design block behave the
same as any other schematic objects and can be edited, moved, deleted,
etc. exactly as if they were added to the schematic normally.

## Saving and managing design blocks

Design blocks are saved in design block libraries, so you need to add a
library before you can save any design blocks. To create a new library,
right click in the library tree and select **New Library…​**. At this
point you must choose whether the new library should be added to the
global design block library table or the project design block library
table. Libraries in the global library table will be available to all
projects, while libraries in the project library table will only be
available in the current project.

<div class="note">

The global and project design block library tables are managed using
**Preferences** → **Manage Design Block Libraries…​**. This includes
deleting and renaming design block libraries. The design block library
tables behave in the same way as the symbol library tables. For more
information about managing library tables, see the [symbol library table
documentation](#managing-symbol-libraries).

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/design_blocks_new_library.png"
alt="design blocks new library" />
</figure>

Following selection of the library table, you must choose a name and
location for the new library. A new, empty library will be created at
the specified location.

After creating the desired design block library, you can create new
design blocks and save them in the library. Design blocks can be created
either from the entire contents of a schematic sheet or from a selection
of schematic objects. To create and save a new design block, select the
desired source objects, either by opening the desired sheet or selecting
the objects in the editing canvas. Then right click the design block
library that will contain the block and select **Save Current Sheet as
Design Block…​** or **Save Selection as Design Block** as appropriate.

<figure>
<img src="images/design_block_properties.png"
alt="design block properties" />
</figure>

This brings up the Design Block Properties dialog, where you can edit
the properties of the new design block.

- **Name**: this is the name of the new design block, which is shown in
  the library tree and the preview pane. It is also used when filtering
  design blocks with the filter textbox. When design blocks are added to
  a schematic as a sheet, this is the default name of the new sheet.

- **Keywords**: these are space-separated keywords describing the design
  block. They are displayed in the design block preview pane and used
  when filtering design blocks with the filter textbox.

- **Description**: this is a description of the design block, which is
  shown in the library tree and the preview pane. It is also used when
  filtering design blocks with the filter textbox.

- **Default Fields**: these are key/value pairs which are included as
  [hierarchical sheet fields](#hierarchical-sheets) when the design
  block is placed as a sheet. Fields are ignored when the design block
  is not placed as a sheet.

You can edit a design block’s properties after creating it by right
clicking the design block in the design block library tree and selecting
**Properties…​**.

# Simulator

KiCad provides an embedded electrical circuit simulator using
[ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net) as the simulation engine.
ngspice is a SPICE simulator derived from the original widely used
Berkeley SPICE program. KiCad’s simulator can also run simulations using
IBIS models of device pins.

The process of creating and running a simulation in KiCad has two main
parts:

1.  Drawing a simulation schematic in KiCad’s Schematic Editor.
    Schematics for simulations are similar to normal schematics (and can
    even be identical), but they typically include simulation-specific
    devices, such as sources, and may exclude devices that are
    irrelevant for simulation, such as connectors. Creating a schematic
    simulation requires ensuring all symbols in the schematic have
    appropriate models assigned. Finding or creating simulation models,
    and then validating them, can be a significant portion of the
    process. KiCad includes some simple simulation models for basic
    devices such as sources, passive devices, and generic semiconductor
    devices, but beyond those you will need to find or create your own
    models.

2.  Running the simulation using the simulator tool. This includes
    choosing the type of analysis (transient, AC, etc.) and configuring
    its options. Multiple different analyses can be performed. The
    simulator provides a plot window to view and analyze simulation
    results.

When drawing schematics for simulation, the `Simulation_SPICE` symbol
library, installed with KiCad by default, may be useful. It contains
common elements used for simulation such as voltage and current sources,
generic semiconductor symbols, and other simulation-specific devices.
The symbols in this library are described in detail
[below](#sim-default-library-symbols).

While these elements enable a great variety of simulation work, users
familiar with SPICE in other environments will be used to incorporating
models of commercially-available semiconductors, integrated circuits,
and other devices as more complex SPICE models. Indeed, semiconductor
manufacturers often freely supply these to help users simulate and
develop circuits using their parts. Note that while KiCad does not
include any commercial SPICE models in its distribution, you are free to
use any models you may have, or have used with other circuit simulators,
in KiCad’s simulator.

In general, if a model works with other SPICE simulators, it should work
with the KiCad simulator, although some SPICE simulators implement
extensions that are unsupported by ngspice. ngspice offers several
compatibility modes to improve compatibility with other simulators.

Finally, to quickly showcase the capabilities of the KiCad simulator,
some demonstration projects are included in the KiCad distribution. They
can be found in the `demos/simulation` directory.

## Assigning models

You need to assign simulation models to symbols before you can simulate
your circuit.

Each symbol can have only one model assigned, even if the symbol
consists of multiple units. For symbols with multiple units, you should
assign the model to the first unit.

SPICE model information is stored as text in symbol fields. Therefore
you may define it in either the symbol editor or the schematic editor.
To assign a simulation model to a symbol, open the Symbol Properties
dialog and click the **Simulation Model…​** button, which opens the
Simulation Model Editor dialog.

You can exclude a symbol from simulation entirely by checking the
**exclude from simulation** checkbox in the Symbol Properties dialog.
Symbols with this attribute set are drawn with a grey outline and a
small simulation icon next to them, as shown below.

<figure>
<img src="images/exclude_from_sim_symbol.png"
alt="exclude from sim symbol" />
</figure>

### Inferred models

Resistor, inductor, and capacitor models can be inferred, which means
that KiCad will detect that they are passives and automatically assign
an appropriate simulation model. Therefore they do not require any
special settings; users only need to set the `Value` field of the
symbol.

KiCad infers simulation models for symbols based on the following
criteria:

- The symbol has exactly two pins,

- The reference designator begins with `R`, `L` or `C`.

Inferred models are ideal models. If the simulation requires a non-ideal
model, for example an inductor with parasitic capacitance included, you
must explicitly assign a model that includes it.

### Built-in models

KiCad offers several standard simulation models. They do not require an
external model file, and their parameters can be edited in KiCad’s
Simulation Model Editor GUI. The following devices are available:

- Resistors (including potentiometers)

- Capacitors

- Inductors

- Transmission lines

- Switches

- Voltage and current sources

- Diodes

- Transistors (BJTs, MOSFETs, MESFETs, and JFETs)

- XSPICE code models

- Raw SPICE elements

To add a built-in model to a symbol, open the Simulation Model Editor
dialog (**Symbol Properties** → **Simulation Model…​**) and select
**Built-in SPICE model**. You can then select the kind of device from
the **device** dropdown and the device subtype from the **device type**
dropdown.

Refer to the [ngspice
documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html) for more
details about these models and their parameters.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_SME_builtin.png"
alt="Interface to set-up built-in models" />
</figure>

**Device** sets the type of device to simulate: a resistor, BJT, voltage
source, etc. This value is stored in the symbol’s `Sim.Device` field.

**Device type** selects the type of model to use for the device. Most
devices have several types of models to choose from. Models may vary in
their degree of accuracy, which characteristics they are optimized for,
what parameters they have available, and how many pins they have. For
example, the **ideal** resistor type models a simple resistor with two
terminals and a single `resistance` parameter, while the
**potentiometer** resistor type models an adjustable resistor with three
terminals and an additional parameter for wiper position. Some devices
have an especially large number of types to choose from: N-channel
MOSFETs, for example, have 17 available types, each of which uses a
different mathematical model to simulate the transistor behavior. One
model may be more or less appropriate than another for simulating a
specific device or circuit or for performing a particular analysis.
Refer to the [ngspice
documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html) for detailed
information about models and their parameters. The **device type** value
is stored in the symbol’s `Sim.Type` field.

The **parameters** tab displays the parameters of the model and lets you
edit them. For example, a resistor’s resistance, a voltage source’s
waveform, a MOSFET’s width and length, etc. Any parameters that differ
from the model’s defaults are stored in the symbol’s `Sim.Params` field.

The **code** tab displays the generated SPICE model as it will be
written to the SPICE netlist for simulation.

The **Save parameter '\<parameter name\>' in Value field** checkbox uses
the symbol’s `Value` field for storing parameters instead of the
`Sim.Params` field. This may make it easier to edit simple models from
the schematic, without opening the Simulation Model Editor. This option
is only available for ideal passive models (R, L, C) and DC sources. If
the field `Sim.Params` exists in the symbol, it will take priority over
the `Value` field.

### External models

KiCad can also load SPICE models from external files. This is typically
how you will add a SPICE model of a specific commercially-available part
(for example, a 555 timer or a TL071 operational amplifier) to your
simulation. Models such as these are readily available from numerous
sources, including manufacturers' web sites. These models must be in a
standard SPICE format and must not be encrypted.

An external model can be one of the following types:

- A device model (`.model`). This is an intrinsic device (a passive,
  diode, transistor, etc.) with a set of parameter values defining its
  behavior. The parameters for a device model are editable in the
  Simulation Model Editor GUI.

- A subcircuit model (`.subckt`). This is a model that uses a collection
  of other ngspice circuit elements to define its behavior. If a
  subcircuit model contains parameters (in a `params:` sequence in its
  definition), the parameters are editable in the Simulation Model
  Editor GUI.

To load a model from an external file, open the Simulation Model Editor
dialog (**Symbol Properties** → **Simulation Model…​**) and select
**SPICE model from file**.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_SME_from_file.png"
alt="Interface to set-up library models from file" />
</figure>

**File** is the path to the model file to use. Unencrypted model files
are plain, human-readable text files and often have extensions such as
`.lib`, `.sub` etc., although KiCad will accept a valid model with any
extension.

The path to the file can be absolute, or relative to the project folder.
The path can also be relative to the value of `SPICE_LIB_DIR` if you
have [defined that path
variable](../kicad/kicad.xml#kicad-environment-variables). If you enable
the **Embed File** checkbox in the file browser, the library file will
be [embedded](#sch-embedding-files) in the schematic (or symbol
library). This makes the schematic (or schematic) more portable as it
doesn’t rely on an external library file. The library filename is saved
in the symbol’s `Sim.Library` field.

**Model** is the name of the desired model in the model file. A model
file may contain multiple models, and if so they will all be shown in
the list. You can filter the list of models using the search box. The
selected model is listed in the symbol’s `Sim.Name` field.

Parameters can be overridden (or additional parameters specified) using
the **Parameters** tab. For device models, all parameters for that type
of device are editable. For subcircuit models, any parameters included
in the subcircuit definition are editable. Any parameters that are
overridden in the **Parameters** tab are stored in the symbol’s
`Sim.Params` field.

The **Code** tab displays the generated SPICE model as it will be
written to the SPICE netlist for simulation.

<div class="note">

KiCad is not distributed with SPICE models for specific commercial
devices. These models are usually available from device manufacturers or
other internet sources.

</div>

### IBIS models

IBIS (I/O Buffer Information Specification) files are an alternative to
SPICE models for modeling the behavior of input/output buffers on
digital parts. In order to load an IBIS file, users should follow the
procedure for SPICE library models, but provide a `.ibs` file.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_SME_ibis.png"
alt="Interface to set-up ibis models" />
</figure>

**File** is the path to the model file to use. The path can be absolute
or relative to the project folder. The path can also be relative to the
value of `SPICE_LIB_DIR` if you have [defined that path
variable](../kicad/kicad.xml#kicad-environment-variables). The library
filename is saved in the symbol’s `Sim.Library` field. If an IBIS model
file is loaded, the remaining fields in the dialog will relate to the
IBIS model.

**Component** selects which component from the IBIS file to use, as IBIS
files can contain multiple components. The component name is saved in
the symbol’s `Sim.Name` field.

**Pin** selects which pin in the IBIS model to simulate. The selected
pin must be mapped to a symbol pin in the **Pin Assignments** tab. The
chosen pin’s number is saved in the symbol’s `Sim.Ibis.Pin` field.

**Model** is the list of models available for the selected pin, for
example an input or an output. The chosen model name is saved in the
symbol’s `Sim.Ibis.Model` field.

**Type** selects what the pin should do in the simulation. A pin can be
a passive **device** that doesn’t drive any value; it can be a **DC
driver** that drives high, low, or high-impedance; or it can be a
**rectangular wave** or **PRBS driver**. This value is stored in the
symbol’s `Sim.Type` field.

The **Parameters** tab lets you see and edit the parameters of the
model. For each parameter, you can switch between a minimum, typical, or
maximum value, as defined in the IBIS file. You can also choose the
parameters of the driven waveform, depending on the pin’s chosen
**type**. Any parameters that differ from the defaults are stored in the
symbol’s `Sim.Params` field.

<div class="note">

KiCad does not ship with IBIS models for symbols. IBIS models are
usually available from device manufacturers.

</div>

<div class="note">

KiCad’s `Simulation_SPICE` symbol library provides several symbols that
may be useful for IBIS simulations. `IBIS_DEVICE` can be used for device
(input) pins, while `IBIS_DRIVER` can be used for simulating driver
pins. There are also variants of each for differential pins.

</div>

### Pin Assignment

Simulation models may have their pins numbered differently than the
corresponding symbol. For example, SPICE models for diodes usually
consider pin 1 to be the anode, while schematic symbols are usually
drawn with pin 1 as the cathode. Operational amplifier models are also
very likely to have model pin assignments that do not match package or
schematic pin numbers.

You can use the Simulation Model Editor’s **Pin Assignments** tab to map
the symbol’s pins to the simulation model pins.

<div class="note">

Always make sure symbol pins are correctly mapped to simulation model
pins. Mistakes here can lead to erroneous or confusing simulation
results, or a failure to simulate at all.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_SME_pin.png" alt="Interface for pin assignment" />
</figure>

The left column displays the name and number of each symbol pin, i.e.
the pin numbers and names that appear on the schematic part in KiCad.
The right column displays the corresponding pin as defined in the model
file in use. For each symbol pin, you can select the corresponding pin
from the simulation model in the dropdown in the right column. In the
cases where a schematic part has pins that are not in the model, as in
the case of an operational amplifier with 'nulling' pins that are not
modeled, the schematic part pin may be assigned to the 'Not Connected'
option in the Pin Assignments dropdown. Unlike other pin assignments,
'Not Connected' may be assigned to multiple pins if necessary.

When you use a subcircuit model, the dialog displays the model’s code
under the pin assignments for use as a reference while assigning pins. A
well-written model will often include a helpful reference section (as a
set of comments) to inform the user how the model pins are mapped.

## Value notation

The simulator supports several notations for writing numerical values in
simulation model parameters, simulation analysis setup options, and
SPICE directives:

- Plain notation : `10100`, `0.003`,

- Scientific notation: `1.01e4`, `3e-3`,

- Prefix notation: `10.1k`, `3m`.

- RKM notation: `4k7`, `10R`.

You can mix prefix and scientific notations. As such, `3e-4k` is a valid
input and is equivalent to `0.3`. The list of valid prefixes is shown
below. They are case sensitive.

| Prefix | Name  | Multiplier       |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| a      | atto  | 10<sup>-18</sup> |
| f      | femto | 10<sup>-15</sup> |
| p      | pico  | 10<sup>-12</sup> |
| n      | nano  | 10<sup>-9</sup>  |
| u      | micro | 10<sup>-6</sup>  |
| m      | milli | 10<sup>-3</sup>  |
| k      | kilo  | 10<sup>3</sup>   |
| M      | mega  | 10<sup>6</sup>   |
| G      | giga  | 10<sup>9</sup>   |
| T      | tera  | 10<sup>12</sup>  |
| P      | peta  | 10<sup>15</sup>  |
| E      | exa   | 10<sup>15</sup>  |

<div class="note">

[Raw SPICE Element](#sim-builtin) models and
[directives](#sim-directives) are passed to ngspice directly, without
KiCad reformatting the values for ngspice to consume. ngspice uses a
different, case-insensitive notation: 1 mega (10<sup>6</sup>) is denoted
there as `1Meg`, while `1M` is 1 milli (10<sup>-3</sup>). Depending on
the compatibility mode selected, ngspice may not support the same value
notations as KiCad, so care should be taken when using raw SPICE
elements and simulation directives.

</div>

## SPICE directives

It is possible to add SPICE directives by placing them in text fields on
a schematic sheet. This approach is convenient for defining the default
simulation type. The list of supported directives in text fields is:

- Directives starting with a dot (e.g. `.tran 10n 1m`)

- Coupling coefficients for inductors (e.g. `K1 L1 L2 0.89`)

It is not possible to place additional components using text fields.

If a simulation command is included in schematic text, the simulator
will use it as the simulation command when you open the simulator.
However, you can override it in the Simulation Command dialog.

Refer to the [ngspice
documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html) for more
details about SPICE directives.

## Running simulations

Circuits for simulation are drawn in the Schematic Editor, but
simulations are run in the Simulator window.

After creating a schematic for simulation, the following steps are
needed to run a simulation:

1.  Open the Simulator window by clicking **Inspect** → **Simulator** in
    the Schematic Editor or using the ![simulator
    icon](images/icons/simulator_24.png) button in the top toolbar.

2.  Create at least one analysis by clicking **Simulation** → **New
    Analysis Tab…​** (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+N</span>) or using the
    ![sim add plot 24](images/icons/sim_add_plot_24.png) button. This
    lets you choose a type of simulation and configure its options.
    These options are explained [below](#simulation-types). Each
    analysis has its own tab, and multiple analyses can be created. The
    options for an analysis can be adjusted after it is created with
    **Simulation** → **Edit Analysis Tab…​** or by clicking on the ![sim
    command 24](images/icons/sim_command_24.png) button.

3.  Run the simulation by clicking **Simulation** → **Run
    Simulation** (R) or by clicking the ![sim run
    24](images/icons/sim_run_24.png) button. This only runs the
    simulation in the active analysis tab. You can stop a running
    simulation at its current point by clicking the ![sim stop
    24](images/icons/sim_stop_24.png) button.

4.  Examine the [simulation results](#sim-results). Most analyses result
    in plots; for these you will need to select the signals to be
    plotted. Other analyses print their results in the output log
    window.

<div class="note">

Once a simulation has been set up, the configuration can be saved in a
[workbook](#sim-workbooks).

</div>

### Simulator window

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_main_dialog.png" alt="Main simulation dialog" />
</figure>

The simulator window is divided into several sections:

- The top of the window has a toolbar with buttons for commonly used
  actions.

- The main part of the window graphically shows the simulation results.
  The simulation needs to run and signals need to be selected from the
  list of available signals or probed before they are displayed in the
  plot.

- Below the plot panel, the output log window shows logs from the
  ngspice simulation engine. Some types of analyses print their results
  here.

- The right side of the window displays a list of signals, a list of
  active cursors, measurements, and a tuning tool for adjusting
  component values based on simulation results.

### Simulation types

Each simulation is a specific type of analysis. The following analysis
types are available:

- **OP** — DC Operating Point

- **DC** — DC Sweep Analysis

- **AC** — AC Small-signal Analysis

- **TRAN** — Transient Analysis

- **PZ** — Pole-zero Analysis

- **NOISE** — Noise Analysis

- **SP** — S-parameter Analysis

- **FFT** — Frequency-content Analysis

Each analysis type and its options are explained below. You can
configure an analysis when you create it (![sim add plot
24](images/icons/sim_add_plot_24.png) button) or by editing an existing
analysis (![sim command 24](images/icons/sim_command_24.png) button).
These analysis types are explained in more detail in the [ngspice
documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html).

<div class="note">

Another way to configure a simulation is to type [SPICE
directives](#sim-directives) into text fields on schematics. Any text
field directives related to a simulation command are overridden by the
settings selected in the dialog. This means that once a simulation has
run, the dialog overrides the schematic directives until the simulator
is reopened.

</div>

#### Operating point analysis (OP)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_op.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="OP analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the DC operating point of the circuit. This analysis has no
options.

Operating point analyses do not have any plotted results. Results are
printed in the output log window. You can also display the node voltages
and device currents calculated by this analysis as
[annotations](#sim-operating-point-annotations) in the schematic.

#### DC sweep analysis (DC)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_dc.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="DC analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the DC behavior of the circuit while sweeping one or two
parameters. The following parameters can be swept:

- value of an independent voltage source

- value of an independent current source

- value of a resistor

- simulation temperature

DC analyses have the following options, which are listed here with the
corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Sweep type**: the type of variable to sweep. This can be a voltage
  source, a current source, a resistor, or the simulation temperature.

- **Source**: the particular voltage source, current source, or resistor
  to sweep (`srcnam`). The list is populated with each item in the
  schematic of the relevant type. It is disabled for temperature sweeps.

- **Starting value**: the starting value for the sweep (`vstart`).

- **Final value**: the ending value for the sweep (`vstop`).

- **Increment step**: the amount to increase the value at each step of
  the sweep (`vincr`). Smaller increments result in more output points.

If **Source 2** is enabled, the same options are available to
simultaneously sweep a second source. Clicking the **Swap sources**
buttons swaps Source 1 with Source 2.

The output is displayed as a plot.

#### AC small-signal analysis (AC)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_ac.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="AC analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the small-signal AC behavior of the circuit in response to a
stimulus. Performs a decade sweep of stimulus frequency.

To run an AC analysis you must choose a number of points to measure per
decade and the start and end frequencies for the decade sweep.

AC analyses have the following options, which are listed here with the
corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Number of points per decade**: the number of points to calculate per
  decade (`nd`).

- **Start frequency**: the lower bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstart`).

- **Stop frequency**: the upper bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstop`).

The output is displayed as a Bode plot (output magnitude and phase vs.
frequency).

#### Transient analysis (TRAN)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_tran.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Transient analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the time-varying behavior of the circuit.

Transient analyses have the following options, which are listed here
with the corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Time step**: a suggested time step (`tstep`).

- **Final time**: the time at which the simulation will end (`tstop`).

- **Initial time**: the time at which the simulation will start
  (`tstart`). If not specified, this defaults to 0.

- **Max time step**: the maximum time step (`tmax`). If not specified,
  this defaults to the suggested time step or the total simulation
  duration divided by 50, whichever is smaller.

- **Use initial conditions**: if enabled, the simulator will not
  calculate the quiescent operating point before starting the transient
  simulation. Instead, the simulation will use the initial conditions
  specified in a `.ic` directive and element `IC` parameters. This
  corresponds to ngspice’s `uic` option.

The output is displayed as a plot.

#### Pole-zero analysis (PZ)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_pz.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Transient analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the poles and zeroes of the small-signal (AC) transfer
function of the circuit.

Pole-zero analyses have the following options, which are listed here
with the corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Transfer function**: selects between calculating the transfer
  function as output voltage divided by input voltage or output voltage
  divided by input current. These correspond to ngspice’s `vol` and
  `cur` options, respectively.

- **Input**: the input node (`node1`) and the reference node for the
  input (`node2`).

- **Output**: the output node (`node3`) and the reference node for the
  output (`node4`).

- **Find**: selects between calculating poles and zeroes, only poles, or
  only zeroes. These correspond to ngspice’s `pz`, `pol`, and `zer`
  options, respectively.

Operating point analyses do not have any plotted results. Results are
printed in the output log window.

#### Noise analysis (NOISE)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_noise.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Noise analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the noise generated by the devices in the circuit, both as
output noise and input-referred noise. The noise spectrum (V/√Hz or
A/√Hz) of the circuit can be plotted, and the total noise over the
specified frequency range is reported. Optionally, the noise
contributions of each device are reported individually.

Noise analyses have the following options, which are listed here with
the corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Measured node**: the node at which output noise is measured
  (`output`).

- **Reference node**: the reference node for measuring the output noise
  (`ref`). The output noise is calculated as the noise at the measured
  node minus the noise at the reference node. If it is not specified,
  the default is the ground node.

- **Noise source**: a source that is considered the circuit’s input for
  the purposes of calculating input-referred noise (`src`). The source
  must specify an AC magnitude, i.e. the source must have an `ac`
  parameter.

- **Number of points per decade**: the number of points to calculate per
  decade (`pts`).

- **Start frequency**: the lower bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstart`).

- **Stop frequency**: the upper bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstop`).

- **Save contributions from all noise generators**: if enabled, noise
  magnitudes of individual noise generators are saved and reported. If
  disabled, only the overall output and input-referred noise over the
  specified frequency range are reported.

The output and input-referred noise spectra can be plotted. Total noise
values for the specified frequency range are printed in the output log
window.

#### S-parameter analysis (SP)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_sp.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="S-parameter analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the scattering parameters, admittance matrix, and impedance
matrix for the circuit. Optionally calculates the noise current
correlation matrix. Note that this analysis requires at least two
voltage sources configured as RF ports as described in the ngspice
manual.

S-parameter analyses have the following options, which are listed here
with the corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Number of points per decade**: the number of points to calculate per
  decade (`nd`).

- **Start frequency**: the lower bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstart`).

- **Stop frequency**: the upper bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstop`).

- **Compute noise current correlation matrix**: if enabled, the noise
  current correlation matrix is also calculated. This corresponds to
  ngspice’s `donoise` option.

The output is displayed as a plot.

#### Frequency content analysis (FFT)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_fft.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="FFT analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates an FFT based on an existing analysis tab. Any of the signals
from an existing analysis can be used as inputs to the FFT. The signals
are windowed using a Hanning window.

FFT analyses have the following options, which are listed here with the
corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Input signals**: the signal(s) to perform an FFT on. An FFT is
  independently applied to each selected signal.

- **Linearize inputs before performing FFT**: When enabled, the input
  vector is converted to have equidistant time points prior to
  performing the FFT. Corresponds to ngspice’s `linearize` command.

The output is displayed as a plot.

#### Additional simulation settings

There are several simulation options that apply to all types of
simulations. These are located at the bottom of the dialog.

- **Add full path for .include library directives**: if enabled,
  relative paths to SPICE models will be converted to absolute paths in
  the SPICE netlist.

- **Save all voltages**: if enabled, the simulator will save voltages
  for each node in the simulation results so that they can be plotted.
  This corresponds to ngspice’s `.save all` command in the SPICE
  netlist. If disabled, voltages will not be saved in the results, and
  therefore cannot be plotted, unless a SPICE directive is used to
  manually probe a node voltage.

- **Save all currents**: if enabled, the simulator will save currents
  through each device pin in the simulation results so that they can be
  plotted. This corresponds to ngspice’s `.probe alli` command in the
  SPICE netlist. If disabled, currents will not be saved in the results,
  and therefore cannot be plotted, unless a SPICE directive is used to
  manually probe a current.

- **Save all power dissipations**: if enabled, the simulator will save
  power dissipations for each device in the simulation results so that
  they can be plotted. This corresponds to ngspice’s
  `.probe P(<device>)` command in the SPICE netlist for each device in
  the schematic. If disabled, power dissipations will not be saved in
  the results, and therefore cannot be plotted, unless a SPICE directive
  is used to manually probe a power dissipation.

- **Save all digital event data**: if enabled, the simulator will save
  digital event data for digital (event-driven) simulation models. This
  corresponds to ngspice’s `.esave all` command. If disabled, digital
  event data will be discarded.

- The **Compatibility mode** dropdown selects the compatibility mode
  that the simulator uses to load models. The **User configuration**
  option refers to the user’s `.spiceinit` ngspice configuration file.
  Compatibility modes are described in the [ngspice
  documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html).

## Viewing simulation results

Each analysis has its own tab, containing its own separate plot, signal
list, and output log window. Only the active tab is updated when a
simulation is run. In this way it is possible to compare simulation
results between different runs.

Simulation results from most analysis types are visualized as
[plots](#sim-plotted-results). However, DC Operating Point (OP) and
Pole-zero (PZ) analyses do not generate plots. Instead, they [print
their results](#sim-numerical-results) in the output log at the bottom
of the simulator window. OP analysis results can additionally be
displayed as [annotations](#sim-operating-point-annotations) on the
schematic canvas.

### Plotted results

Most types of analyses display their results in a plot. The type of plot
depends on the analysis: transient simulations display signal values
over time, for example, while AC simulations display results in a Bode
plot.

You can zoom and move a plot using the following gestures:

- Scroll mouse wheel to zoom in/out. Shift, Ctrl, and Alt can modify the
  scroll action depending on the configuration in the Simulator panel in
  the Schematic Editor Preferences.

- Right click to open a context menu to adjust the view.

- Draw a selection rectangle to zoom in the selected area.

- Drag a cursor marker to move the cursor.

The list of signals that can be plotted in the active plot is shown in
the Signals pane on the right side of the simulator window. The
following types of signals can be plotted:

- Node voltages: the voltage of each net in the schematic, displayed as
  `V(<net>)`.

- Device node currents: the current for each device in the schematic,
  displayed as `I(<device>)` or `I(<device:terminal>)`. For two-terminal
  devices, the device’s current is listed as a single signal
  corresponding to the current into the device’s pin 1. For devices with
  more than two terminals, the current into each terminal is a separate
  signal.

- Device power dissipations: the power dissipated by each component,
  displayed as `P(<device>)`.

- [User-defined signals](#sim-user-defined-signals): custom signals
  defined as an expression based on other signals. User-defined signals
  can be arbitrary mathematical expressions. One common use for
  user-defined signals is to plot a voltage differential, i.e. the
  voltage between two points.

To plot a signal, check the box in the plot column next to the signal of
interest. To remove a signal from the plot, clear its checkbox.

You can also interactively select signals to plot by using the Probe
Schematic tool. To activate the tool, use **Simulation** → **Probe
Schematic…​** (P) or click the (![sim probe
24](images/icons/sim_probe_24.png)) button. When activated, the tool
lets you click elements in the schematic to plot the corresponding
signal. Different types of signals are probed depending on what you
click:

- Clicking on a wire plots the voltage of that net. When you hover over
  a wire, the net is highlighted to indicate that its voltage can be
  probed.

- Clicking on a symbol pin plots the current going into that pin. When
  you hover over a pin, the cursor changes to a current clamp to
  indicate that clicking will probe the current.

<div class="note">

KiCad does not support ngspice’s `.plot` directive. This directive has
no effect when a simulation is run using KiCad.

</div>

#### Plot settings and appearance

Colors of individual signals may be set by clicking the color field
associated with each signal in the Signals grid. You may choose from a
predefined palette (**Defined Colors**), or select a custom color
(**Color Picker**). You can toggle the color of the plot background from
black to white with **View** → **Dark Mode Plots** (this affects all
analysis tabs, not just the active tab).

Many plot settings can be configured in the **Plot Setup** tab of the
Analysis Setup window (![sim command
24](images/icons/sim_command_24.png) button).

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_plot_setup.png" alt="sim plot setup" />
</figure>

- **Fixed scale**: when enabled, this fixes the vertical and/or
  horizontal plot scales to the specified ranges. Manually zooming will
  not affect an axis if its scale is fixed.

- **Show grid**: when enabled, a grid will be shown behind the plotted
  signals. You can also turn the grid on or off with **View** → **Show
  Grid**.

- **Show legend**: when enabled, a legend will be shown on the plot for
  the enabled signals. You can reposition the legend by dragging it.

- **Dotted current/phase**: when enabled, plotted signals representing
  current (transient simulations) or phase (AC simulations) are
  displayed using dotted lines instead of solid lines. You can also
  enable this setting with **View** → **Dotted Current/Phase**.

- **Margins**: this controls the padding on each side of the plot.

#### Cursors

For precise measurement, cursors are available in the plot window. You
can add a cursor to a signal by checking the **Cursor 1** or **Cursor
2** checkbox for the signal in the signal grid on the right.

Once cursors have been added, the horizontal position of each cursor is
shown by a number in a triangular marker at the top of the plot display.
You can reposition each cursor by clicking and dragging its marker. The
vertical position of each cursor tracks its assigned signal. The
horizontal and vertical value for each cursor are shown in the cursor
grid on the right of the simulator window. If cursors 1 and 2 are both
enabled, the difference between them is also shown.

To precisely position a cursor, you can directly edit its horizontal
position in the cursors grid. You can also modify the display format
(unit range and number of significant digits) by right clicking a value
in the cursors grid and clicking **Format** for the relevant quantity.

You can also add more cursors beyond the two default cursors. To create
more cursors, right click on a signal in the signals grid and click
**Create new cursor**. To remove an extra cursor, right click in a one
of the extra cursor columns and click **Delete cursor 3** (or whichever
cursor you want to delete).

#### Measurements

You can add automatically calculated measurements for any plotted
signal, such as a minimum, average, or peak-to-peak measurement.

<div class="note">

Measurements are made over all the data resulting from the simulation,
not just the data that is visible in the plot window at the current zoom
setting.

</div>

<div class="note">

It is not necessary to have selected a signal for plotting (by selecting
its Plot checkbox) in order to make a measurement on it. Even unplotted
signals can be measured.

</div>

To add a predefined measurement to a signal, right click on a signal in
the signals grid and select a measurement. The following measurements
are available:

- **Measure Min**: measures the minimum value of the entire signal

- **Measure Max**: measures the minimum value of the entire signal

- **Measure RMS**: measures the root-mean-square value of the entire
  signal

- **Measure Peak-to-peak**: measures the peak-to-peak value of the
  entire signal

- **Measure Time of Min**: measures the time at which the minimum value
  of the entire signal occurs

- **Measure Time of Max**: measures the time at which the maximum value
  of the entire signal occurs

- **Measure Integral**: computes the time integral value of the entire
  signal

- **Perform Fourier Analysis**: performs a Fourier analysis of the
  selected signal based on a specified fundamental frequency. Calculates
  the amplitude of the harmonics of the fundamental as well as the total
  harmonic distortion. This measurement is only available for transient
  analyses, and its results are printed in the simulation log window
  instead of in the measurement panel.

Measurement results are displayed in the Measurement pane at the lower
right of the Simulator window. Multiple measurements will display as
multiple rows in this area. You can delete a measurement by right
clicking it and clicking **Delete Measurement**. To modify the display
format of a measurement result (unit range and number of significant
digits), right click the value and click **Format Value…​**.

The above context menu options are a shortcut for directly specifying
measurements in the the Measurement pane. To manually create a new
measurement, click in an empty row in the Measurement pane and type in
an ngspice measurement function. You can also edit existing measurements
by clicking on them. For more information about measurements and their
syntax, refer to the ngspice manual.

### Numerical results

While most analyses display their results as plots, DC Operating Point
(OP) and Pole-zero (PZ) analyses do not result in plots. Instead, these
analyses print their results as text in the simulation log window.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_pz_results.png" alt="sim pz results" />
</figure>

#### Operating point annotations

For the OP analysis, annotations can also be added to the schematic
indicating the operating point voltage and current values at the nodes.
Operating point voltage annotations can be shown or hidden for every
node with **View** → **Show OP Voltages**. Operating point current
annotations can be shown or hidden for every symbol pin with **View** →
**Show OP Currents**. These annotations are globally shown or hidden for
every node or every pin. You can control the formatting of these
annotations in the [Formatting panel of Schematic
Setup](#schematic-setup-formatting).

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_op_voltages.png" alt="sim op voltages" />
</figure>

You can also display operating point results using text variables. Using
text variables requires more work to set up but provides more control
over how the data is displayed. For example, you can use text variables
to display only certain voltages or currents, or to control the display
formatting of particular values. You can also use text variables to
display power dissipation measurements.

To use text variables to display an operating point voltage for a net,
add a [label](#labels) to the net, then add a field to that label. The
label can contain any text as long as it contains the `${OP}` text
variable. The text variable can contain formatting specifiers in the
form `${OP.<precision><unit>}`, but both the precision and unit are
optional. Precision is the number of significant digits to display,
which is 3 by default. Unit is the unit to use, including a prefix, such
as `mV` for millivolts.

As an example, a label field containing the text `Vout: ${OP}`, attached
to a net with an operating point voltage of 5.123V, displays as "Vout:
5.12V". The text `${OP.4mV}` displays as "5123mV", `${OP.2}` displays as
"5.1V", and `${OP.mV}` displays as "512mV".

Using text variables to display an operating point current into a device
pin is similar, but uses symbol fields instead of label fields. The
field can contain any text as long as it contains the `${OP:<pin>}` text
variable. The pin can be specified as a pin name or a pin number. For
two-terminal devices, the pin can be omitted, and the current into the
device’s pin 1 will be reported. The same optional formatting specifiers
are supported as for voltages, in the form
`${OP:<pin>.<precision><unit>}`.

For example, in a symbol with an operating point current of 5.123mA
through pin 1 (pin name `C`), a symbol field containing the text
`Ic: ${OP:C}` displays as "Ic: 5.12mA". The text `${OP:C.2mA}` displays
as "5.1mA", `${OP:1.4}` displays as "5.123mA", and `${OP:C.A}` displays
as "0.00512A".

You can also use text variables to display a device’s power dissipation.
This works identically to current, but with `power` instead of a pin
name or number. For example, in a symbol with an operating point power
dissipation of 5.123mW, a symbol field containing `${OP:power.2mW}`
displays as "5.1mW".

<div class="note">

Don’t forget to set the label field or symbol field to visible, or it
will not be displayed.

</div>

### User-defined signals

In addition to the list of signals that come from the nets in the
schematic, you can define your own signals which behave like normal
signals in most respects. User defined signals are defined as
mathematical operations on one or more basic signals.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_user_defined_signals.png"
alt="sim user defined signals" />
</figure>

To add a user-defined signal, open the User-defined Signal dialog with
**Simulation** → **User-defined Signals…​** (![sim add signal
24](images/icons/sim_add_signal_24.png) button) and add a signal. The
new signal will appear in the Signal grid, where it can be plotted and
used like any other signal. User-defined signals are also included in OP
results.

<div class="note">

Unlike normal signals, which are plotted incrementally as a simulation
progresses, user-defined signals are not plotted until the simulation
completes.

</div>

One use for user-defined signals is to plot a differential voltage, i.e.
the voltage between two arbitrary nodes. For example, to plot the
voltage difference between the nets `/v1` and `/v2`, you can create a
user-defined signal with the expression `/v1-/v2` and then plot it. This
expression could also be written in a number of different ways, for
example `V(/v1)-V(/v2)` or `V(/v1,/v2)`, which are both equivalent.

A number of mathematical functions are available for use in user-defined
signals. To see a list, click the **Syntax help** link in the
User-defined Signals dialog. Refer to the ngspice manual for details on
each of these functions.

<div class="note">

Net names may contain special characters that have particular meaning to
the ngspice interpreter. In particular, ngspice interprets the dash
character (`-`) as a subtraction operation. To ensure that net names are
interpreted correctly, surround the net name with double quote (`"`)
characters when referring to it in a user-defined signal.

</div>

## Tuning components

It is possible to adjust the value of basic components in the schematic
from within the simulation interface, which lets you conveniently adjust
component values based on simulation results. Each time the component
value is tuned, the simulation is re-run with the new component value.
You can tune the value of passive resistors, inductors, and capacitors,
or the voltage or current of DC voltage and current sources.

<div class="note">

You can only tune components when running analyses that result in a
plot. In other words, you cannot tune components when running an
operating point analysis.

</div>

To tune a component, use **Simulation** → **Add Tuned Value…​**, the
keyboard shortcut T, or the ![tune icon](images/icons/sim_tune_24.png)
button in the toolbar, and then click on the component to tune in the
schematic. This adds a tuning control for that component in the bottom
right corner of the simulator window. Multiple components can be tuned
at once, with a separate tuning control per component.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_tuner.png" alt="sim tuner" />
</figure>

- The top text field sets the top end of the tuning range.

- The bottom text field sets the bottom end of the tuning range.

- The middle text field sets the actual component value that is used in
  the simulation. This value can also be adjusted using the slider.

- The **Save** button updates the schematic symbol with the tuned value.
  Until you press the **Save** button, the schematic symbol will keep
  its original value.

- The ![trash icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button removes the
  component from the Tune panel and restores its original value.

In addition, it is possible to restrict the component values to those
from a particular series of Preferred Values — either of the E24, E48,
E96 or E192 series. This is particularly useful when it is necessary to
restrict component values to commercially available parts.

## Saving simulation setups

You can save a simulation setup in a workbook. Workbooks are files that
store information about a simulation setup, including which analyses are
configured and what their settings are, which signals are plotted for
each analysis, user-defined signals, measurements, cursors, and display
settings. A workbook can be saved and reloaded later to restore the
previously configured settings in a new session. Workbooks can include
more than one simulation: for example, it may contain separate tabs for
transient, operating point, and AC analyses which you added as you
worked.

You can save a workbook using **File** → **Save Workbook** and load one
using **File** → **Open Workbook**. The most recently used workbook is
automatically loaded when the simulator is opened.

<div class="note">

Workbooks store simulation setup information, but they do not store
simulation results. You can export simulation results to PNG (graphics)
or CSV (simulation data values) with **File** → **Export Current Plot as
PNG…​** and **File** → **Export Current Plot as CSV…​**. To recreate the
results of simulations stored in a workbook, select the appropriate
analysis tab in the Simulator window and run the simulation again (R or
**Simulation** → **Run Simulation**).

</div>

## Exporting simulation results

KiCad’s simulator offers two ways to export results:

- as a PNG (Portable Network Graphics format) image of a simulation data
  plot,

- as a plain text file of simulation data values, in CSV
  (Comma-Separated Value) format.

Only simulations that produce plots (see above) can be exported as an
image or a CSV file. The results of OP and PZ analyses cannot be
exported in this way.

### Exporting results as graphics

The currently-visible Simulator plot may be exported as a PNG file using
the command **File** → **Export Current Plot as PNG…​**.

The size and aspect-ratio of the saved image will match that of the
displayed plot in the Simulator.

You can also copy an image of the active plot to the clipboard using
**File** → **Export Current Plot to Clipboard**, or insert an image of
the active plot into the schematic using **File** → **Export Current
Plot to Schematic**. Exporting a plot to the schematic is equivalent to
exporting the plot to the clipboard and then pasting it into the
schematic.

### Exporting results as numerical data

The currently-visible Simulator plot may be exported as a CSV file using
the command **File** → **Export Current Plot as CSV…​**.

The data in the simulation plot is exported as multiple columns. The
precise format is dependent upon the analysis type. In general, there
will be multiple columns of data, one corresponding to each variable
selected for plotting. The first row of the file is a header row,
containing the name of the variable in the column (i.e. 'time',
'V(/Vout)1' or similar).

<div class="note">

When exporting to CSV, only variables selected using their Plot checkbox
will be included in the exported file.

</div>

<div class="note">

The data in the exported file contains all the data that would be
plotted if the entire plot were displayed. If the plot is zoomed in to
show a particular region this will still be the case, resulting in the
output file containing more data than the user might expect.

</div>

<div class="note">

This function exports the data with data separated by semicolons (`;`)
rather than commas. Programs reading this data may need to be configured
to expect a semicolon as a delimiter.

</div>

## Troubleshooting simulations

Sometimes a simulation will fail, either with or without errors being
reported. Paying attention to the error messages reported, taking care
in the development and entry into KiCad of the circuit to be simulated,
and making use of the KiCad, ngspice and general SPICE documentation and
information from fellow users in forums is very worthwhile and can often
point the way to a solution.

It’s worth noting, for users unfamiliar with SPICE, ngspice or circuit
simulation in general that some 'common' and interesting circuits can
sometimes be tricky to simulate accurately or reliably. These include
apparently simple circuits such as oscillators, which in some cases may
fail to oscillate at all! It is nearly always possible to build a
working simulation but sometimes this can more require SPICE experience
than might be initially apparent, or the guidance of someone who already
has it. The ngspice documentation, once again, is worth reading for
insights into good and effective simulation practices if you are
encountering difficulty.

### Incorrect netlist

It is possible to inspect the SPICE netlist with **Simulation** → **Show
SPICE netlist…​** (![netlist 24](images/icons/netlist_24.png) button).
This method of troubleshooting requires some SPICE knowledge, but
spotting errors in the netlist can help determine the cause of
simulation problems, as well as providing confirmation of what input
ngspice is actually acting on.

### Simulation error messages

The output console displays messages from the simulator. It is advisable
to check the console output to verify there are no errors or warnings.
Messages appearing in the console may be conveniently selected, copied,
and pasted if you wish to share them.

A common error message is "timestep too small". This message means that
the simulation engine is unable to calculate the next point in the
simulation, even when using the minimum possible time increment. This
error can have many causes, including numerical convergence issues with
a simulation model used in the circuit or with the circuit itself. It
can also be caused by mistakes in drawing the circuit, such as
incorrectly [assigning pins to the simulation
model](#simulation-pin-assignment) or forgetting to provide a voltage
supply.

### Convergence problems

In case the simulation does not converge in a reasonable amount of time
(or not at all), it is possible to add the following SPICE directives.
More information is available in the ngspice manual.

<div class="warning">

Changing convergence options can lead to erroneous results. These
options should be used with caution.

</div>

    .options gmin=1e-10
    .options abstol=1e-10
    .options reltol=0.003
    .options cshunt=1e-15

- `gmin` is the minimum conductance allowed by the program. The default
  value is `1e-12` (1 pS).

- `abstol` is the absolute current error tolerance of the program. The
  default value is `1e-12` (1 pA).

- `reltol` is the relative error tolerance of the program. The default
  value is `0.001` (0.1%).

- `cshunt` adds a capacitor of the specified value from each voltage
  node in the circuit to ground.

### Simulation pin assignments

If unexpected results are generated by a simulation despite it running
without obvious errors, it is worth double-checking that the
[assignments between the pins of the part instance in the KiCad
schematic and that of the associated model](#simulation-pin-assignment)
are correct. These have to be correct for each instance of the model in
the schematic.

## Helpful hints

Some helpful tips, hints and advice to help you get the most from using
ngspice in KiCad for simulation.

### The ngspice manual is your friend!

Fundamentally the KiCad Simulator is a user-friendly front-end to the
powerful ngspice circuit simulator. Therefore problems with the details
of simulation, the correct use of SPICE elements, models, etc. is beyond
the scope of the KiCad documentation but is very likely to be fully and
completely addressed in the ngspice documentation itself. It’s therefore
recommended not to overlook this [valuable
resource](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html).

<div class="note">

KiCad updates may result in changes to the ngspice version used by the
simulator. The current version of ngspice used in a particular version
of KiCad is shown on the **Help** → **About KiCad** dialog, under the
**Version** tab. Referring to the online ngspice documentation will
ensure you always have access to the latest information for reference.

</div>

### Organizing third-party models

Although it is certainly possible to keep simulation models (i.e.
`.lib`, `.sub` files) in the directories associated with individual
KiCad projects, this will likely result in unnecessary copies of model
files proliferating as you create simulations. Consider creating a
dedicated storage location (directory, folder) for models, perhaps
organized by manufacturer or device type, to hold these files. Then they
may simply be referenced in simulations at a common location.

### Simulation symbols and models in KiCad’s libraries

The KiCad libraries provide a number of symbols for simulation in the
`Simulation_SPICE` symbol library. Most of these symbols have SPICE
models already assigned as appropriate, although you may need to adjust
the model parameters in order to obtain the desired simulation behavior.

The `Simulation_SPICE` symbol library contains the following symbols:

|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Most of these symbols in the `Simulation_SPICE` library use [built-in
models](#sim-built-in), but several symbols use [external
models](#sim-library) from the `Simulation_SPICE.sp` simulation model
library. The simulation model library is a separate file in the same
folder as the symbol library. This simulation model library also
contains SPICE models that may be useful for use with other symbols.

The `Simulation_SPICE.sp` simulation model library contains the
following models:

## Configuration and Customization

<div class="note">

This section of the KiCad documentation has not yet been written. We
appreciate your patience as our small team of volunteer documentation
writers work to update and expand the documentation.

## Text variables

KiCad supports text variables, which allow you to substitute the
variable name with a defined text string. This substitution happens
anywhere the variable name is used inside the variable replacement
syntax of `${VARIABLENAME}`.

You can define project text variables in the
[schematic](#schematic-setup-text-variables) or [board
setup](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#board-setup-text-variables) dialogs. Project
text variables are defined for the whole project, so a project text
variable defined in the Schematic Editor can also be used in the Board
Editor.

There are also a number of built-in system text variables. System text
variables may be available in some contexts and not others. The
following system text variables can be used in schematic text, label
names, label fields, hierarchical sheet fields, symbol text, symbol
fields, and drawing sheet fields. There are also a number of [variables
that can be used in the PCB
Editor](../pcbnew/pcbnew.xml#text-variables).

Variables used in hierarchical sheet fields refer to the properties of
the hierarchical sheet, not the parent, unless otherwise noted. For
example, `${#}` returns the subsheet’s page number when used in a
hierarchical sheet field, but the parent sheet’s page number when used
in graphic text in the parent sheet.

Variables can also be used for field names. A field with a variable as
its name will automatically have its value set to the same variable. For
example, in a project with a project variable `MY_VAR` set to
`MY_VALUE`, a user-created symbol field named `${MY_VAR}` will
automatically have its value set to `${MY_VAR}`, which will then resolve
to `MY_VALUE`. If the field’s **Show Name** property is set, the
variable’s name will be displayed as the field name, for example
`MY_VAR: MY_VALUE`.

## Database Libraries

A database library is a type of KiCad symbol library that holds data
about parts in an external SQL database. Database libraries do not
contain any symbol or footprint definitions by themselves. Instead, they
**reference** symbols and footprints found in other KiCad libraries.
Each database library entry maps a KiCad symbol (from another library)
to a set of properties (fields) and usually a KiCad footprint (from a
footprint library).

Using database libraries allows you to create fully-defined parts
(sometimes called **atomic parts**) out of KiCad symbols and footprints
without needing to store all the part properties in a symbol library.
The external database can be linked to third-party tools for managing
part data and lifecycles. Database library workflows are generally more
complex than the standard KiCad library workflows, and so this type of
library is typically only used in situations where it makes managing a
large library of fully-defined parts more efficient (such as in
organization or team settings).

KiCad does not provide a GUI for editing a SQL database or defining a
database library. It is up to the user to find the most appropriate
workflow and toolchain for creating and updating the database itself.
Some users may want to directly edit the database through a third-party
database client, and some may use other third-party software such as a
part lifecycle management (PLM) tool to create and edit data.

In a database library, there are one or more **tables** that generally
represent a single type of part (such as Resistors or Capacitors). Each
table can have an independent schema, meaning that different types of
parts can have different properties that are translated into symbol
fields in KiCad. Each table must have a unique ID column which is used
as the identifier for a symbol placed from that table. This unique ID
will typically be a part number (either a manufacturer’s part number, or
an internal organization part number). Each table must also have a
column that contains a mapping to a KiCad symbol, in the form
`LibraryNickname:SymbolName`. The `LibraryNickname` must match a symbol
library that is present in the KiCad library tables. Tables may also
contain a column containing a KiCad footprint, in the form
`LibraryNickname:FootprintName`. If this column is present, symbols
placed from the table will include a footprint mapping.

Tables may also contain arbitrary additional columns that may optionally
be mapped to symbol fields in KiCad. The KiCad database library
configuration file controls how these fields should be named, whether or
not to make the fields visible, and whether or not to include the fields
in the data displayed in the Symbol Chooser.

### Database Library Configuration Files

To create a database library, you must create a configuration file that
contains the necessary information for KiCad to connect to your database
and retrieve data from tables. Copy the template below into a new file
and save it with a `kicad_dbl` extension. You can then add this file to
your global symbol library table using the Configure Symbol Libraries
dialog.

                },
                {
                    "column": "Value",
                    "name": "Value",
                    "visible_on_add": true,
                    "visible_in_chooser": true,
                    "show_name": false

                "exclude_from_board": "Schematic Only"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

<div class="note">

Database library files are in JSON format. Standard JSON syntax rules
apply. To check if your file contains syntax errors, you may use a JSON
validator or linter (available online).

</div>

#### Configuring the source

KiCad currently only supports ODBC connections to SQL databases. You can
either connect with a DSN or a connection string. If a DSN name is
supplied, the optional `username` and `password` fields will be used to
connect to the DSN. If a connection string is supplied, the `dsn`,
`username`, and `password` fields are ignored. The connection string
will be passed directly to the ODBC driver, so you can include any
parameters your ODBC driver supports.

When using a DSN connection, leave the `connection_string` property
blank or omit it from the file. When using a connection string, leave
the `dsn`, `username`, and `password` fields blank or omit them from the
file. Connection strings must start with a `Driver` key indicating to
the ODBC manager which driver should be used, and may include other keys
that depend on the specific driver. Check the documentation for your
ODBC driver for details. You may also find a reference site like
[connectionstrings.com](https://www.connectionstrings.com/) useful when
configuring a database connection.

KiCad does not recommend or endorse any particular ODBC driver or
database server, but has been tested to work with Sqlite, MySQL,
MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.

<div class="note">

Windows users: the backslash character (`\`) must be escaped with a
second backslash when included in a JSON quoted string. If including a
file path in your connection string, make sure to use double backslashes
(`\\`).

</div>

<div class="note">

Flatpak users: You need to install the corresponding ODBC drivers as
Flatpak extensions. You can do this via the "Add-ons" section for KiCad
in your software manager (i.e. GNOME Software), or via the command line:
Run `flatpak install org.kicad.KiCad.ODBCDriver.sqliteodbc` for SQLite,
`flatpak install org.kicad.KiCad.ODBCDriver.mariadb-connector-odbc` for
MariaDB or MySQL, or
`flatpak install org.kicad.KiCad.ODBCDriver.psqlodbc` for PostgreSQL.

</div>

<div class="note">

Flatpak users: Due to Flatpak sandboxing, a possible way to connect to
database servers running on your local machine is via TCP/IP. Make sure
that your database server allows TCP/IP connections, then add the
required `Port` parameter to your connection string. For example, add
`Port=3306;` for the default TCP port of MySQL/MariaDB, or
`Server=localhost;Port=5432;` to force PostgreSQL to use a TCP
connection to the local server. Using the default UNIX domain socket
connections for MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL is only possible when
overriding host file system permissions via `flatpak override`.

</div>

#### Configuring libraries

Each database library can contain "sub-libraries" mapped to a single
database table. The `libraries` entry in the configuration file contains
a list of objects that each define a single library. The following
settings must exist for each library:

`name`: The name of the sub-library (table) that will be shown in the
KiCad UI and included as a prefix in each symbol name placed from this
sub-library. This name can include any valid characters for a symbol
name except for a forward slash (`/`) because the slash character is
used as a separator between the sub-library name and the symbol name. If
this field is left blank, no prefix will be added to symbols in this
sub-library.

`table`: The name of the table in the database.

`key`: The column name containing a unique key that will be used to
identify parts from the table.

`symbols`: The column name containing KiCad symbol references.

`footprints`: The column name containing KiCad footprint references.

`fields`: A list of field definitions. Each field defined here will be
added to the symbol when it is placed on the schematic. If a field with
a matching name is already defined in the source symbol, the value from
the database table will override whatever value was defined in the
source symbol. Each field definition may contain:

`column`: The name of the database table column that should be mapped to
a field.

`name`: The name of the KiCad field to populate from the database.

`visible_on_add`: If `true`, this field will be visible in the schematic
when a symbol is added. If this setting is not specified, it will
default to `false`.

`visible_in_chooser`: If `true`, this field will be shown in the Symbol
Chooser as a column. If this setting is not specified, it will default
to `false`.

`show_name`: If `true`, the field’s name will be shown in addition to
its value in the schematic. If this setting is not specified, it will
default to `false`.

`inherit_properties`: If `true`, and a field with the given `name`
already exists on the source symbol, only the field contents will be
updated from the database, and the other properties (`visible_on_add`,
`show_name`, etc) will be kept as they were set in the source symbol. If
the given field name does not exist in the source symbol, this setting
is ignored. If this setting is not specified, it will default to
`false`.

`properties`: A map of symbol properties to database columns. All
properties are optional; any that are not specified in the database
library configuration will be inherited from the values set for the
source symbol. The following properties are supported:

`description`: The symbol’s Description property.

`footprint_filters`: Reserved for future expansion.

`keywords`: The symbol’s Keywords property.

`exclude_from_bom`: The symbol’s "Exclude from Bill of Materials"
setting. The column named here must be a numeric type, and will be taken
as a boolean (0 for false, 1 for true).

`exclude_from_board`: The symbol’s "Exclude from PCB" setting. The
column named here must be a numeric type, and will be taken as a boolean
(0 for false, 1 for true).

`exclude_from_sim`: The symbol’s "Exclude from simulation" setting. The
column named here must be a numeric type, and will be taken as a boolean
(0 for false, 1 for true).

Database columns may be mapped to custom (user-defined) fields, or to
certain built-in KiCad fields, including `Value` and `Datasheet`.

<div class="note">

KiCad only supports text (string) fields. If you map a database column
containing a numeric SQL data type, it will be converted to a string
using a general-purpose conversion algorithm that will switch to
scientific notation for very large or very small numbers. This format
conversion cannot be fine-tuned by the user, so if explicit control over
number-to-string conversion is needed, a new column or view should be
used to do the conversion in the database.

</div>

### Using database libraries

After creating your configuration file and adding it to your symbol
library table, you can place parts from the database tables using the
Symbol Chooser. Parts placed from a database library can be updated
using the Update Symbols from Library function, which will update any
fields that were changed in the database as well as updating the
underlying symbol if it was changed in the source library.

Note that any source library referenced by a database table must also be
present in the symbol library table for the database library to
function. If you want to use a library only as a source of symbols for a
database library, you can hide it from the Symbol Chooser by clearing
the "Visible" checkbox in the Manage Symbol Libraries dialog.

## HTTP Libraries

HTTP libraries are a type of KiCad symbol library that sources data
about parts for an external source such as an ERP system. They do not
contain any symbol or footprint definitions as standard KiCad libraries
do. Instead, they **reference** symbols and footprints found in other
KiCad libraries.

HTTP libraries are read only and support REST or REST-like APIs.

### HTTP Library Configuration Files

To create an HTTP library, you must create a configuration file that
contains the necessary information for KiCad to connect to the providing
library (API) and to retrieve data from it.

Copy the template below into a new file and save it using the
`.kicad_httplib` file extension. You should then edit this file and
replace `root_url` and `token` values with your own. Once saved, add
this file to your global symbol library table using the Configure Symbol
Libraries dialog which can be found under **Preferences→Manage Symbol
Libraries…​**.

Users have the option to configure two timeout settings. The
`timeout_parts_seconds` setting dictates the validity duration of a
part’s information, while the `timeout_categories_seconds` setting
determines how long categories remain valid. The default values are set
to 60 seconds and 600 seconds respectively, but if the data for either
setting is anticipated to remain unchanged, users can opt for higher
values. This will significantly speed up the opening of the symbol
chooser. It’s important to note that KiCad will re-cache the data on the
initial startup regardless of these timeout settings.

    {
        "meta": {
            "version": 1.0
        },
        "name": "KiCad HTTP Library",
        "description": "A KiCad library sourced from a REST API",
        "source": {
            "type": "REST_API",
            "api_version": "v1",
            "root_url": "http://localhost:8000/kicad-api",
            "token": "usertokendatastring",
            "timeout_parts_seconds": 60,
            "timeout_categories_seconds": 600
        }
    }

### Authentication

Authentication is done via an **Access Token** only. Users need to ask
their administrators to get a valid token issued if the HTTP library is
maintained externally.

### Caching Behaviour for Categories

KiCad caches all available Categories once when opening the Symbol
Chooser Dialog. Subsequently, any alterations made to the categories on
the server side will remain undetected by KiCad until the user performs
a program restart. This implementation is intentionally designed to
conserve bandwidth resources, as it prevents KiCad from attempting to
retrieve data from the API every time the user opens the Symbol Chooser
Dialog. Such continuous data fetching, especially under constrained
bandwidth conditions, would severely impede KiCad’s performance.

### Server Response Codes

If KiCad receives an API error, it will display an error message to the
user. For more information about API errors and server responses, see
the APIs and Bindings section at dev-docs.kicad.org.

## Custom Netlist and BOM Formats

KiCad can output netlists and BOMs in various formats, and users can
define new formats if desired.

The process of exporting a netlist is described in the [netlist export
section](#netlist-export). BOM output is described in the [BOM export
section](#bom-export).

The following section describes how to create an exporter for a new
output format.

### Adding new netlist generators

New netlist generators are added to the **Export Netlist** dialog by
clicking the **Add Generator…​** button.

<figure>
<img src="images/eeschema_netlist_dialog_add_plugin.png"
style="width:40.0%" alt="Custom Netlist Generator" />
</figure>

New generators require a name and a command. The name is shown in the
tab label, and the command is run whenever the **Export Netlist** button
is clicked.

When the netlist is generated, KiCad creates an intermediate XML file
which contains all of the netlist information from the schematic. The
generator command is then run in order to transform the intermediate
netlist into the desired netlist format.

The netlist command must be set up properly so that the netlist
generator script takes the intermediate netlist file as input and
outputs the desired netlist file. The exact netlist command will depend
on the generator script used. The [command
format](#generator-command-line-format) is described below.

Python and XSLT are commonly used tools to create custom netlist
generators.

### Adding a new BOM generator

KiCad also uses the intermediate netlist file to generate BOMs with the
[Generate BOM tool](#bom-export).

<figure>
<img src="images/en/dialog_bom.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="BOM dialog" />
</figure>

Additional scripts can be added to the list of BOM generator scripts by
clicking the ![Plus icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) button.
Scripts can be removed by clicking the ![Delete
icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button. The ![Edit
icon](images/icons/small_edit_16.png) button opens the selected script
in a text editor.

Generator scripts written in Python and XSLT can contain a header
comment that describes the generator’s functionality and usage. This
header comment is displayed in the BOM dialog as the description for
each generator. The header comment must contain the string `@package`.
Everything following that string until the end of the comment is used as
the description for the generator.

KiCad automatically fills the command line field when a new generator
script is added, but the command line might need to be adjusted by hand
depending on the generator script. KiCad attempts to automatically
determine the output file extension from the example command line in the
generator script’s header.

### Generator command line format

The command line for a netlist or BOM exporter defines the command that
KiCad will run to generate the selected output file.

For a netlist exporter using `xsltproc`, an example is:

`xsltproc -o %O.net /usr/share/kicad/plugins/netlist_form_pads-pcb.asc.xsl %I`

For a BOM exporter using Python, an example is:

`/usr/bin/python3 /usr/share/kicad/plugins/bom_csv_grouped_by_value.py "%I" "%O.csv"`

<div class="note">

It is recommended to surround arguments in the command line with quotes
(`"`) in case they contain spaces or other special characters.

</div>

Some character sequences like `%I` and `%O` have a special meaning in
the command line, because KiCad replaces them with a filename or path
before executing the command.

| Parameter | Replaced with…​                      | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `%I`      | `<project path>/<project name>.xml` | Absolute path and filename of the intermediate netlist file, which is the input to the BOM or netlist generator plugin                                                 |
| `%O`      | `<project path>/<project name>`     | Absolute path and filename of the output BOM or netlist file (without file extension). An appropriate file extension may need to be specified after the `%O` sequence. |
| `%B`      | `<project name>`                    | Base filename of the output BOM or netlist file (without path or file extension). An appropriate file extension may need to be specified after the `%B` sequence.      |
| `%P`      | `<project path>`                    | Absolute path of the project directory, without trailing slash.                                                                                                        |

### Intermediate Netlist File

When exporting BOM files and netlists, KiCad creates an intermediate
netlist file and then runs a separate tool which post-processes the
intermediate netlist into the desired netlist or BOM format.

The intermediate netlist uses XML syntax. It contains a large amount of
data about the design. Depending on the output (BOM or netlist),
different subsets of the complete intermediate netlist file will be
included in the final output file.

The structure of the intermediate netlist file is described in detail
[below](#intermediate-netlist-structure).

Because the conversion from intermediate netlist file to output netlist
or BOM is a text-to-text transformation, the post-processing filter can
be written using Python, XSLT, or any other tool capable of taking XML
as input.

<div class="note">

XSLT is not recommended for new netlist or BOM exporters; Python or
another tool should be used instead. Beginning with KiCad 7, `xsltproc`
is no longer installed with KiCad, although it can be installed
separately. Nevertheless, several examples of netlist exporters using
XSLT are included below.

</div>

#### General netlist file structure

The intermediate Netlist accounts for five sections.

- The header section.

- The components section.

- The lib parts section.

- The libraries section.

- The nets section.

The file content has the delimiter `<export>`

``` xml
<export version="D">
...
</export>
```

#### The header section

The header has the delimiter `<design>`

``` xml
<design>
<source>F:\kicad_aux\netlist_test\netlist_test.sch</source>
<date>21/08/2010 08:12:08</date>
<tool>eeschema (2010-08-09 BZR 2439)-unstable</tool>
</design>
```

This section can be considered a comment section.

#### The components section

The component section has the delimiter `<components>`

``` xml
<components>
<comp ref="P1">
<value>CONN_4</value>
<libsource lib="conn" part="CONN_4"/>
<sheetpath names="/" tstamps="/"/>
<tstamps>4C6E2141</tstamps>
</comp>
</components>
```

This section contains the list of components in your schematic. Each
component is described like this:

``` xml
<comp ref="P1">
<value>CONN_4</value>
<libsource lib="conn" part="CONN_4"/>
<sheetpath names="/" tstamps="/"/>
<tstamps>4C6E2141</tstamps>
</comp>
```

| Element name | Element description                                                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `libsource`  | name of the lib where this component was found.                                                 |
| `part`       | component name inside this library.                                                             |
| `sheetpath`  | path of the sheet inside the hierarchy: identify the sheet within the full schematic hierarchy. |
| `tstamps`    | timestamp of the component.                                                                     |

##### Note about time stamps for components

To identify a component in a netlist and therefore on a board, the
timestamp reference is used as unique for each component. However KiCad
provides an auxiliary way to identify a component which is the
corresponding footprint on the board. This allows the re-annotation of
components in a schematic project and does not lose the link between the
component and its footprint.

A time stamp is an unique identifier for each component or sheet in a
schematic project. However, in complex hierarchies, the same sheet is
used more than once, so this sheet contains components having the same
time stamp.

A given sheet inside a complex hierarchy has an unique identifier: its
sheetpath. A given component (inside a complex hierarchy) has a unique
identifier: the sheetpath and its timestamp.

#### The libparts section

The libparts section has the delimiter `<libparts>`, and the content of
this section is defined in the schematic libraries.

``` xml
<libparts>
<libpart lib="device" part="CP">
  <description>Condensateur polarise</description>
  <footprints>
    <fp>CP*</fp>
    <fp>SM*</fp>
  </footprints>
  <fields>
    <field name="Reference">C</field>
    <field name="Valeur">CP</field>
  </fields>
  <pins>
    <pin num="1" name="1" type="passive"/>
    <pin num="2" name="2" type="passive"/>
  </pins>
</libpart>
</libparts>
```

| Element name   | Element description                                                                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<footprints>` | The symbol’s footprint filters. Each footprint filter is in a separate `<fp>` tag.                                                  |
| `<fields>`     | The symbol’s fields. Each field’s name and value is given in a separate \`\<field name="fieldname"\>…​\</field\> tag.                |
| `<pins>`       | The symbol’s pins. Each pin is given in a separate `<pin num="pinnum" type="pintype"/>` tag. Possible pintypes are described below. |

Possible electrical pin types are:

| Pintype        | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Input          | Usual input pin                                  |
| Output         | Usual output                                     |
| Bidirectional  | Input or Output                                  |
| Tri-state      | Bus input/output                                 |
| Passive        | Usual ends of passive components                 |
| Unspecified    | Unknown electrical type                          |
| Power input    | Power input of a component                       |
| Power output   | Power output like a regulator output             |
| Open collector | Open collector often found in analog comparators |
| Open emitter   | Open emitter sometimes found in logic            |
| Not connected  | Must be left open in schematic                   |

#### The libraries section

The libraries section has the delimiter `<libraries>`. This section
contains the list of schematic libraries used in the project.

``` xml
<libraries>
  <library logical="device">
    <uri>F:\kicad\share\library\device.lib</uri>
  </library>
  <library logical="conn">
    <uri>F:\kicad\share\library\conn.lib</uri>
  </library>
</libraries>
```

#### The nets section

The nets section has the delimiter `<nets>`. This section describes the
connectivity of the schematic by listing all nets and the pins connected
to each net.

``` xml
<nets>
  <net code="1" name="GND">
    <node ref="U1" pin="7"/>
    <node ref="C1" pin="2"/>
    <node ref="U2" pin="7"/>
    <node ref="P1" pin="4"/>
  </net>
  <net code="2" name="VCC">
    <node ref="R1" pin="1"/>
    <node ref="U1" pin="14"/>
    <node ref="U2" pin="4"/>
    <node ref="U2" pin="1"/>
    <node ref="U2" pin="14"/>
    <node ref="P1" pin="1"/>
  </net>
</nets>
```

A possible net contains the following.

``` xml
<net code="1" name="GND">
  <node ref="U1" pin="7"/>
  <node ref="C1" pin="2"/>
  <node ref="U2" pin="7"/>
  <node ref="P1" pin="4"/>
</net>
```

| Element name | Element Description                                                                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `net code`   | an internal identifier for this net                                                           |
| `name`       | the net name                                                                                  |
| `node`       | the pin (identified by `pin`) of a symbol (identified by `ref`) which is connected to the net |

### Example netlist exporters

Some example netlist exporters using XSLT are included below.

XSLT itself is an XML language very suitable for XML transformations.
[The `xsltproc` program](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc.html) can be
used to read the Intermediate XML netlist input file, apply a
style-sheet to transform the input, and save the results in an output
file. Use of `xsltproc` requires a style-sheet file using XSLT
conventions. The full conversion process is handled by KiCad, after it
is configured once to run `xsltproc` in a specific way.

The document that describes XSL Transformations (XSLT) is available
here: <http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt>

<div class="note">

When writing a new netlist exporter, consider using Python or another
tool rather than XSLT.

</div>

#### PADS netlist example using XSLT

The following example shows how to create an exporter for the PADS
netlist format using `xlstproc`.

The PADS netlist format is comprised of two sections:

- A list of footprints

- A list of nets, together with the pads connected to each net.

Below is an XSL style-sheet which converts the intermediate netlist file
to the PADS netlist format.

``` xml

        </xsl:otherwise>
    </xsl:choose>
    <xsl:text>&nl;</xsl:text>
</xsl:template>

<!-- for each net -->
<xsl:template match="net">
    <!-- nets are output only if there is more than one pin in net -->
    <xsl:if test="count(node)>1">
        <xsl:text>*SIGNAL* </xsl:text>
        <xsl:choose>
            <xsl:when test = "@name != '' ">
                <xsl:value-of select="@name"/>
            </xsl:when>
            <xsl:otherwise>
                <xsl:text>N-</xsl:text>
                <xsl:value-of select="@code"/>
            </xsl:otherwise>
        </xsl:choose>
        <xsl:text>&nl;</xsl:text>
        <xsl:apply-templates select="node"/>
    </xsl:if>
</xsl:template>

<!-- for each node -->
<xsl:template match="node">

    <xsl:text>.</xsl:text>
    <xsl:value-of select="@pin"/>
    <xsl:text>&nl;</xsl:text>
</xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
```

And here is the PADS netlist output file after running `xsltproc`:

    *PADS-PCB*
    *PART*
    P1 unknown
    U2 unknown
    U1 unknown
    C1 unknown
    R1 unknown
    *NET*
    *SIGNAL* GND
    U1.7
    C1.2
    U2.7
    P1.4
    *SIGNAL* VCC
    R1.1
    U1.14
    U2.4
    U2.1
    U2.14
    P1.1
    *SIGNAL* N-4
    U1.2
    U2.3
    *SIGNAL* /SIG_OUT
    P1.2
    U2.5
    U2.2
    *SIGNAL* /CLOCK_IN
    R1.2
    C1.1
    U1.1
    P1.3

    *END*

The command line to make this conversion is:

`kicad\\bin\\xsltproc.exe -o test.net kicad\\bin\\plugins\\netlist_form_pads-pcb.xsl test.tmp`

#### Cadstar netlist example using XSLT

The following example shows how to create an exporter for the Cadstar
netlist format using `xlstproc`.

The Cadstar format is comprised of two sections:

- The footprint list

- The Nets list: grouping pads references by nets

Below is an XSL style-sheet which converts the intermediate netlist file
to the Cadstar netlist format.
