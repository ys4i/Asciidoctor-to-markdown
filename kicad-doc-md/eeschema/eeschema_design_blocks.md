# Schematic design blocks

Schematic design blocks allow you to save a portion of a schematic and
reuse it later. You can reuse design blocks within the same schematic or
in different schematics. Design blocks are saved and organized in design
block libraries, much like symbols and footprints. When you use a design
block, the saved schematic fragment is inserted into the current
schematic, either in the current sheet or in a new subsheet.

To use schematic design blocks, first show the Design Blocks panel by
clicking **View** → **Panels** → **Design Blocks**. This opens a docked
panel on the right side of the schematic editor. To close the panel, use
the same menu entry or right click in the panel and choose **Hide
Library Tree**.

## Using design blocks in a schematic

The Design Blocks panel contains a library tree that lists your design
block libraries and the design blocks contained in each library. Each
library can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the design blocks
in that library. There is a **Recently Used** pseudo-library at the top
of the tree that contains any design blocks that you have recently
placed. You can pin any libraries to the top of the list by right
clicking the library and selecting **Pin Library**.

You can filter design blocks by their name, description, and keywords
using the filter textbox at the top of the Design Blocks panel. By
default, matches are sorted by best match, but you can change to sorting
alphabetically using the ![small sort desc
16](images/icons/small_sort_desc_16.png) button.

When you select a design block in the library tree, the design block’s
name and metadata are displayed below the library tree along with a
graphical preview of the design block. The metadata includes the block’s
description and keywords.

To add a design block to the schematic, double click it in the library
tree or right click a design block and select **Place Design Block**.

If the **Place as sheet** checkbox is enabled, you will need to click
twice in the editing canvas to place two corners of a [hierarchical
sheet](#hierarchical-sheets). The design block contents will be placed
in the new sheet. If the **Place as sheet** checkbox is not enabled,
clicking once in the canvas will place the contents of the design block
directly into the current schematic.

If the **Place repeated copies** checkbox is enabled, KiCad will begin
placing the design block again when you finish placing the previous
block. To cancel placing the next block, press Esc or right click and
select **Cancel**.

If the **Keep annotations** checkbox is enabled, KiCad will insert the
design block without changing the symbol annotations as defined in the
saved design block. If it is not enabled, KiCad will reset the symbol
annotations while inserting the design block and reannotate all of the
symbols in the block according to the current annotation settings.

Once placed in a schematic, the contents of a design block behave the
same as any other schematic objects and can be edited, moved, deleted,
etc. exactly as if they were added to the schematic normally.

## Saving and managing design blocks

Design blocks are saved in design block libraries, so you need to add a
library before you can save any design blocks. To create a new library,
right click in the library tree and select **New Library…​**. At this
point you must choose whether the new library should be added to the
global design block library table or the project design block library
table. Libraries in the global library table will be available to all
projects, while libraries in the project library table will only be
available in the current project.

<div class="note">

The global and project design block library tables are managed using
**Preferences** → **Manage Design Block Libraries…​**. This includes
deleting and renaming design block libraries. The design block library
tables behave in the same way as the symbol library tables. For more
information about managing library tables, see the [symbol library table
documentation](#managing-symbol-libraries).

Following selection of the library table, you must choose a name and
location for the new library. A new, empty library will be created at
the specified location.

After creating the desired design block library, you can create new
design blocks and save them in the library. Design blocks can be created
either from the entire contents of a schematic sheet or from a selection
of schematic objects. To create and save a new design block, select the
desired source objects, either by opening the desired sheet or selecting
the objects in the editing canvas. Then right click the design block
library that will contain the block and select **Save Current Sheet as
Design Block…​** or **Save Selection as Design Block** as appropriate.

This brings up the Design Block Properties dialog, where you can edit
the properties of the new design block.

- **Name**: this is the name of the new design block, which is shown in
  the library tree and the preview pane. It is also used when filtering
  design blocks with the filter textbox. When design blocks are added to
  a schematic as a sheet, this is the default name of the new sheet.

- **Keywords**: these are space-separated keywords describing the design
  block. They are displayed in the design block preview pane and used
  when filtering design blocks with the filter textbox.

- **Description**: this is a description of the design block, which is
  shown in the library tree and the preview pane. It is also used when
  filtering design blocks with the filter textbox.

- **Default Fields**: these are key/value pairs which are included as
  [hierarchical sheet fields](#hierarchical-sheets) when the design
  block is placed as a sheet. Fields are ignored when the design block
  is not placed as a sheet.

You can edit a design block’s properties after creating it by right
clicking the design block in the design block library tree and selecting
**Properties…​**.
