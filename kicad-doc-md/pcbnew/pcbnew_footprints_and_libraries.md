# Footprints and footprint libraries

KiCad organizes footprints into footprint libraries, which hold
collections of footprints. Each footprint in a board is uniquely
identified by a full name that is composed of a library nickname and a
footprint name. For example, the identifier
`Capacitor_SMD:C_0603_1608Metric` refers to the `C_0603_1608Metric`
footprint in the `Capacitor_SMD` library.

## Managing footprint libraries

KiCad uses a table of footprint libraries to map footprint libraries of
any supported library type to a library nickname. KiCad uses a global
footprint library table as well as a table specific to each project. To
edit either footprint library table, use **Preferences** → **Manage
Footprint Libraries…​**.

<figure>

alt="footprint library table dialog" />
</figure>

The global footprint library table contains the list of libraries that
are always available regardless of the currently loaded project. The
table is saved in the file `fp-lib-table` in the KiCad configuration
folder. [The location of this
folder](../kicad/kicad.xml#config-file-location) depends on the
operating system being used.

The project specific footprint library table contains the list of
libraries that are available specifically for the currently loaded
project. If there are any project-specific footprint libraries, the
table is saved in the file `fp-lib-table` in the project folder.

KiCad’s footprint library management system allows directly using many
types of footprint libraries, including formats that are native to other
non-KiCad EDA tools:

- KiCad `.pretty` footprint libraries (folders with `.pretty` extension,
  containing `.kicad_mod` files)

- KiCad Legacy footprint libraries (`.mod` files)

- Altium Designer (`.PcbLib` or `.IntLib` files)

- CADSTAR PCB Archive (`.cpa` files)

- Eagle footprint libraries (`.lbr` files)

- EasyEDA / JLCEDA Standard Edition (`.json` or `.zip` files)

- EasyEDA / JLCEDA Professional Edition (`.elibz`, `.epro`, or `.zip`
  files)

- GEDA libraries (folders containing `.fp` files)

Non-KiCad footprint libraries, including KiCad Legacy footprint
libraries, can be migrated to KiCad `.pretty` format using the **Migrate
Libraries** button (see the [migrating
libraries](#migrating-footprint-libraries) section).

<div class="note">

KiCad only supports writing to KiCad’s native `.pretty` format footprint
libraries (and the `.kicad_mod` footprint files within them). All other
footprint library formats are read-only. To modify a non-KiCad format
footprint library, you must first convert it to KiCad format.

</div>

### Initial Configuration

The first time the PCB Editor (or any other KiCad tool that uses
footprints) runs and the global footprint table file `fp-lib-table` is
not found, KiCad will guide the user through setting up a new footprint
library table. This process is described
[above](#initial-configuration). You can re-run this process at any time
by clicking the **Reset Libraries**.

<div class="warning">

Resetting your footprint library table will permanently change your
footprint library table on disk.

</div>

### Managing Table Entries

Footprint libraries can only be used if they have been added to either
the global or project-specific footprint library table.

Add a library either by clicking the ![Folder
icon](images/icons/small_folder_16.png) button and selecting a library
or clicking the ![Plus icon](images/icons/small_plus_16.png) button and
typing the path to a library file. The selected library will be added to
the currently opened library table (Global or Project Specific).
Libraries can be removed by selecting desired library entries and
clicking the ![Delete icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button.

The ![Up icon](images/icons/small_up_16.png) and ![Down
icon](images/icons/small_down_16.png) buttons move the selected library
up and down in the library table. This does not affect the display order
of libraries in the Footprint Library Browser, Footprint Editor, or Add
Footprint tool.

Libraries can be made inactive by unchecking the **Active** checkbox in
the first column. Inactive libraries are still in the library table but
do not appear in any library browsers and are not loaded from disk,
which can reduce loading times.

A range of libraries can be selected by clicking the first library in
the range and then Shift-clicking the last library in the range.

Each library must have a unique nickname: duplicate library nicknames
are not allowed in the same table. However, nicknames can be duplicated
between the global and project library tables. Libraries in the project
table take precedence over libraries with the same name in the global
table.

Library nicknames do not have to be related to the library filename or
path. The colon character (`:`) cannot be used in library nicknames or
footprint names because it is used as a separator between nicknames and
footprints.

Each library entry must have a valid path. Paths can be defined as
absolute, relative, or by [path variable
substitution](#fp-path-variable-substitution).

The appropriate library format must be selected in order for the library
to be properly read. The supported formats are listed above. Only KiCad
format libraries (`.pretty` folders containing `.kicad_mod` files) can
be saved. Other footprint library formats are read-only and must be
converted to KiCad format before you can modify them.

There is an optional description field to add a description of the
library entry. The option field is not used at this time so adding
options will have no effect when loading libraries.

### Path Variable Substitution

The footprint library tables support path variable substitution, which
allows you to define path variables containing custom paths to where
your libraries are stored. PATH variable substitution is supported by
using the syntax `${PATH_VAR_NAME}` in the footprint library path.

By default, KiCad defines several path variables which are described in
the [project manager
documentation](../kicad/kicad.xml#kicad-environment-variables). Path
variables can be configured in the **Preferences** → **Configure
Paths…​** dialog.

Using path variables in the footprint library tables allows libraries to
be relocated without breaking the footprint library tables, so long as
the path variables are updated when the library location changes.

<div class="note">

KiCad will automatically resolve versioned path variables from older
versions of KiCad to the value of the corresponding variable from the
current KiCad version, as long as the old variable is not explicitly
defined itself. For example, `${KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR}` will
automatically resolve to the value of `${KICAD9_FOOTPRINT_DIR}` if there
is no `KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR` variable defined.

</div>

`${KIPRJMOD}` is a special path variable that always expands to the
absolute path of the current project directory. `${KIPRJMOD}` allows
libraries to be stored in the project folder without having to use an
absolute path in the project library table. This makes it possible to
relocate projects without breaking their project library tables.

### Using the GitHub Plugin

<div class="note">

KiCad removed support for the GitHub library plugin in version 6.0.

</div>

### Migrating footprint libraries to KiCad format

Non-KiCad format libraries, including legacy libraries (`.mod` files),
are read-only. They need to be converted to KiCad format (`.kicad_mod`
files in a `.pretty` folder) before you can save changes to them.

<div class="note">

As with most KiCad files, newer versions of KiCad can open older-format
library files, but older versions of KiCad cannot read files once they
have been saved by a newer version of KiCad.

</div>

Libraries in other formats can be converted to KiCad libraries by
selecting them in the footprint library table and clicking the **Migrate
Libraries** button. Multiple libraries can be selected and migrated at
once by Ctrl-clicking or shift-clicking.

Libraries can also be converted one at a time by opening them in the
Footprint Editor and saving them as a new library.

## Creating and editing footprints

A footprint is the physical interface between a component package and a
circuit board. Footprints can contain:

- Pads, which define how the component will be physically assembled onto
  the footprint. When a footprint is added to a board, tracks are routed
  to pads, and pads provide a magnetic snapping point for the router to
  connect the pad to a track. Pad shapes and layers are fully
  customizable, and pads can have plated holes, unplated holes, or no
  hole.

- Graphic shapes and text for technical or aesthetic purposes. Graphics
  can be placed on physical layers (e.g. silkscreen or soldermask) or
  nonphysical layers. Graphic shapes can also be placed on copper
  layers, in which case they can make electrical connections.

- 3D models for mechanical CAD and visualization. 3D models are normally
  external files that footprints can link to, but they can optionally be
  embedded in footprints.

- Metadata associated with the footprint.

Footprints in KiCad are organized into footprint libraries, which
contain zero or more footprints. Generally footprints are logically
grouped by footprint category, function, and/or manufacturer. Each
library is a folder (usually ending in `.pretty`) containing a
`.kicad_mod` file for each footprint in the library.

### Footprint editor overview

KiCad provides a footprint editing tool that allows you to create
footprint libraries; add, edit, delete, or transfer footprints between
libraries; export footprints to files; and import footprints from files.
The Footprint Editor can be launched from the KiCad Project Manager or
from the Board Editor (**Tools** → **Footprint Editor**). You can also
open the Footprint Editor from the [a footprint in the
board](#board-editing-footprints); in this way you can edit either the
library copy or the board copy of that footprint in the editor.

<div class="note">

Editing the library version of a footprint will not affect any copies of
that footprint that have been added to a board until the board copy is
updated from the library. Conversely, editing the board version of a
footprint will not affect the library version of a footprint or any
other copies of that footprint in a board.

</div>

The Footprint Editor main window is shown below. It has three toolbars
for quick access to common features and a footprint viewing/editing
canvas. Not all commands are available on the toolbars, but all commands
are available in the menus.

In addition to the toolbars, there are collapsible panels for the
footprint tree and Properties Manager (not shown) on the left, and the
appearance panel and selection filter on the right. The bottom of the
window contains a message panel that shows details about the selected
object.

### Browsing, modifying, and saving footprints

The ![Footprint tree icon](images/icons/search_tree_24.png) button
displays or hides the list of available libraries, which allows you to
select an active library. When a new footprint is created, it will be
placed in the active library.

Clicking on a footprint name opens that footprint in the editor, and
hovering the cursor over the name of a footprint displays a preview of
the footprint.

After modification, a footprint can be saved in the current library or a
different library. To save the modified footprint in the current
library, click the ![Save icon](images/icons/save_24.png) button.

To save the footprint changes to a new footprint, click **File** →
**Save As…​**. The footprint can be saved in the current library or a
different library, and a new name can be set for the footprint.

To create a new file containing only the current footprint, click
**File** → **Export** → **Footprint…​**. This file will be a standard
footprint library which will contain only one footprint.

The editor can also open footprints from the board. To edit a footprint
from the board, right click a footprint in the Board Editor and select
**Open in Footprint Editor** (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+E</span>).
Alternatively, you can open a board footprint by pressing the ![load
module board 24](images/icons/load_module_board_24.png) button in the
Footprint Editor top toolbar and selecting the desired footprint.

Editing and saving the board copy of a footprint will only update that
footprint in the board; it will not update other copies of that
footprint in the board, and it will not change the original library copy
of the footprint. When you open the board copy of a footprint, the
Footprint Editor displays an info bar that warns you the library copy
will not be modified. You can click the link in this info bar to open
the library version of the footprint instead, or press
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+E</span>.

### Creating a new footprint library

You can create a new footprint library by clicking **File** → **New
Library…​**. At this point you must choose whether the new library should
be added to the global footprint library table or the project footprint
library table. Libraries in the global library table will be available
to all projects, while libraries in the project library table will only
be available in the current project.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_new_library.png"
alt="footprint editor new library" />
</figure>

Following selection of the library table, you must choose a name and
location for the new library. A new, empty library will be created at
the specified location.

### Creating a new footprint

To create a new footprint in the current footprint library, click the
![New Footprint icon](images/icons/new_footprint_24.png) button or click
**File** → **New Footprint…​**. A new, untitled footprint will be created
in the selected library.

To set the name of the footprint, open its [properties
dialog](#footprint-editor-properties) (![module options
24](images/icons/module_options_24.png) button or E). The name will set
the name of the footprint, which is used when assigning a footprint to a
symbol, and is also used as the filename of the footprint file on disk.

The new footprint will be empty except for several default text items.
The footprint contains two default (mandatory) footprint fields,
`Reference` and `Value`. `Reference` contains the text `REF**`, which
will be replaced with the reference designator of the footprint’s
corresponding symbol when the [footprint is added to the
board](#starting-from-a-schematic). `Value` is initially set to
`Untitled`, which can be changed, but this will also be updated with the
contents of the corresponding symbol’s `Value` field when the footprint
is added to the board. Finally, there is a footprint text item
containing the string `${REFERENCE}`, which is a [text
variable](#text-variable) that will resolve to the value of the
footprint’s `Reference` field once the footprint is on a board.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_empty_footprint.png"
alt="footprint editor empty footprint" />
</figure>

These items are centered on the footprint’s anchor (origin point), which
is indicated with a magenta cross symbol. The anchor can be repositioned
(changing the `(0, 0)` point for the footprint) by selecting the
![Anchor icon](images/icons/anchor_24.png) button and clicking on the
new desired anchor position.

<div class="note">

Rather than manually creating a footprint, for some common footprints
you can use a [footprint wizard](#footprint-wizards) to create a
footprint based on a set of parameters.

</div>

### Editing footprint properties

Footprints have a number of properties and metadata items that can be
defined. These include text fields, attributes that can be set or not
(such as Do Not Populate), clearance and zone connection settings, and
3D model paths. These are initially defined in the library copy of the
footprint, but they can be modified on a per-instance basis once a
footprint is added to a board. In other words, two copies of the same
footprint on a single board can their properties edited separately.

Some properties, namely text fields and attributes, will be
automatically set for each footprint in a board based on the fields and
attributes in the footprint’s corresponding schematic symbol. Fields and
attributes are synced from symbols to footprints when you perform the
[Update PCB From Schematic](#forward-and-back-annotation) action. They
are also synced from footprints back to symbols when you perform the
Update Schematic From PCB action.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_properties.png"
alt="footprint editor properties" />
</figure>

To edit footprint properties, click the ![module options
24](images/icons/module_options_24.png) button to show the Footprint
Properties dialog. You can also double click an empty spot in the
editing canvas.

#### Footprint name, description, and keywords

The footprint name, description, and keywords describe the footprint
itself. Together they are intended to describe the footprint and help
you select an appropriate footprint for each component. They are also
used when searching for footprints in the Footprint Editor and the Add
Footprint dialog.

The **footprint name** contains the name of the footprint. This is the
same as the footprint’s filename on disk, and is also initially the same
as the footprint’s `Value` field. However, the `Value` field can be
edited in the footprint editor, and when a footprint is added to a
board, its `Value` field will be updated with the value of the
footprint’s corresponding symbol.

The **description** is a description of the footprint. It should be
human readable, but it is also used when searching for a footprint.

<div class="note">

This description property is specifically a description of the
**footprint**. This is not to be confused with the `Description` field,
which will be set to the description of the footprint’s corresponding
**symbol** when the footprint is added to a board.

</div>

The **keywords** are space-separated words related to the footprint.
They are used when searching for a footprint.

#### Footprint fields

Footprints contain multiple fields, which are named values containing
information related to the footprint. Fields can be visible and shown on
any board layer, or they can be hidden and only shown in the footprint’s
properties. Some fields have special meaning to KiCad: `Reference` and
`Footprint` are both both used by KiCad to identify schematic symbols
and PCB footprints, for example. Other fields may contain information
that is important for a design but is not interpreted by KiCad, like
pricing or stock information for a part.

Any fields defined in a library footprint will be included in the
footprint when it is added to a board. You can also add new fields to
footprints in the board. Whether they are in the library footprint or
not, these fields can then be edited on a per-footprint basis in the
board. Symbol fields are also transferred to the board and added as
fields in the corresponding footprint.

<div class="note">

Footprint fields are different than graphic text. Fields are named, i.e.
they have both a name (`Reference`) and a value (`R101`), whereas
footprint text only has a value. Fields can be added to and deleted from
footprints in a board in the Footprint Properties dialog, while text
items can only be added to a footprint in the footprint editor. Fields
are also synced between footprints and their corresponding symbols in
the schematic. Before KiCad version 8.0, footprints did not have named
fields, only graphic text.

</div>

All library footprints are defined with four default fields which
correspond to the [default fields in library
symbols](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#symbol-properties): `Reference`,
`Value`, `Datasheet`, and `Description`. These default fields cannot be
deleted. The `Reference` field initially has the value `REF**`, while
the `Value` field is initially set to the name of the footprint. In the
board, the values of the four default fields will be set to the values
of the matching fields in the footprint’s corresponding symbol.

<div class="note">

The `Description` footprint field is the description of the symbol, not
the footprint, and will be overwritten by the value of the corresponding
symbol’s description. Footprints have a separate footprint description
property (not a field), which is specifically intended for a description
of the footprint.

</div>

Fields each have an associated layer, which determines which board layer
the field will be placed on. Fields can also be visible or hidden.

To edit an existing footprint field, double-click the field, select it
or hover and press E, or right-click on the field text and select
**Properties…​**.

To add new fields, delete optional fields, or edit existing fields, use
the ![module options 24](images/icons/module_options_24.png) icon on the
main tool bar to open the Footprint Properties dialog. Fields can be
arbitrarily named, but names starting with `ki_`, e.g. `ki_description`,
are reserved by KiCad and should not be used for user fields.

Fields have a number of properties, each of which is shown as a column
in the properties grid. Not all columns are shown by default; columns
can be shown or hidden by right clicking on the grid header and
selecting or deselecting columns from the menu.

#### Footprint attributes

Footprints have several attributes, which are properties of the
footprint that affect how it is handled by other parts of KiCad.

Every footprint has a **component type**: **SMD**, **Through hole**, or
**Unspecified**. A footprint’s type affects KiCad’s behavior in a few
ways:

- Footprint type controls the default type of new pads added to the
  footprint. For **through hole** and **Unspecified** footprints, new
  pads will be through hole by default, although they can be changed
  after creation. For **SMD** footprints, new pads will be SMD by
  default.

- Footprint type can be used to filter footprints from component
  placement files as well as other exports, such as STEP files.
  Additionally, the footprint type is included as metadata in IPC-2581
  exports.

- Footprint 3D models can be shown and hidden in the 3D viewer based on
  their type. For example, SMD models can be hidden while through hole
  models are still displayed.

- Footprints of different types are reported separately in the [Board
  Statistics dialog](#board-statistics).

- DRC will report footprints containing pads that do not match the
  parent footprint’s type, for example through hole pads in an SMD
  footprint.

If **not in schematic** is checked, KiCad will not expect the footprint
to correspond to a symbol in the schematic. When updating a PCB from the
schematic, KiCad will ordinarily remove footprints that don’t have
corresponding symbols according to the **delete footprints with no
symbols** setting. However, such footprints will not be deleted when
they have **not in schematic** set.

If **exclude from POS files** is checked, KiCad will not include the
footprint in component placement file exports.

If **exclude from bill of materials** is checked, the component will not
be included in bill of materials exports in either the schematic or PCB
editors. This attribute is synced to and from the footprint’s
corresponding schematic symbol.

If **exempt from courtyard requirement** is checked, the footprint will
not trigger a DRC violation if it does not contain a courtyard. Without
this attribute set, a footprint without graphics on the `F.Courtyard` or
`B.Courtyard` layer will cause a "Footprint has no courtyard defined"
DRC violation.

The **do not populate** attribute is primarily a schematic symbol
attribute, and is synced to and from the footprint’s corresponding
schematic symbol. Footprints with this attribute set can optionally be
excluded from component placement file exports and some other types of
outputs. These footprints can also be hidden in the 3D viewer.

#### Private footprint layers

Footprints can have private footprint layers, which are layers that can
be viewed and edited in the Footprint Editor but are not shown in the
footprint when it is added to a board. Therefore any objects that are on
private layers will not be visible in the PCB Editor or included in PCB
fabrication outputs. This may be useful, for example, for notes or
graphics that are of interest when drawing or editing a footprint but
not needed at the board level.

Any of the existing `User.*` layers (`User.Drawings`, `User.Comments`,
`User.Eco1`, `User.1`, etc.) can optionally be a private layer. To make
a layer private, add a private layer in the **General** tab of the
footprint properties dialog, then select the desired layer. Any objects
on that layer will not be shown on the board.

#### Clearance overrides and settings

The **Clearance Overrides and Settings** tab holds settings for
footprint-specific overrides to board clearance and mask/paste
expansion, pad-to-zone connections, and net tie settings for allowing
pads within the footprint to short different nets.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_properties_clearance.png"
alt="footprint editor properties clearance" />
</figure>

**Pad clearance** controls the minimum clearance between the footprint’s
pads and any copper shape (tracks, vias, pads, zones) on a different
net. This value is normally empty, which will cause the pad clearance to
be inherited from the board’s design rules and netclass rules. This
value can be overridden for individual pads by setting the pad’s
clearance to a nonblank value.

<div class="note">

Prior to KiCad version 9, a pad clearance of `0` caused the pad
clearance value to be inherited. In KiCad 9 and later, a pad clearance
of `0` sets the clearance to `0`, while a blank pad clearance causes the
clearance to be inherited.

</div>

The aperture appearing on any technical layer will have the same shape
and size as the pad shape on the copper layer(s). In the PCB
manufacturing process, the manufacturer will often change the relative
size of mask and paste apertures relative to the copper pad size, but
since this size change is specific to a manufacturing process, most
manufacturers expect the design data to be provided with the apertures
set to the same size as the copper pads. For specific situations where
you need to oversize or undersize a technical layer aperture in the
design data, you can use the settings here. These values can be
overridden for individual pads by setting the pad’s expansion or
clearance to a nonzero value.

**Solder mask expansion** controls the size difference between the pad
shape and the aperture shape on the F.Mask and B.Mask layers. A positive
number means the solder mask aperture will be larger than the copper
shape. This number is an inflation applied to all directions. For
example, a value of `0.1mm` here will cause the solder mask aperture to
be inflated by `0.1mm`, meaning that there will be an `0.1mm` border on
all sides of the pad and the solder mask opening will be `0.2mm` wider
than the pad when measured along a given axis.

**Solder paste absolute clearance** controls the size difference between
the pad shape and the aperture shape on the F.Paste and B.Paste layers.
Its behavior is otherwise identical to the behavior of the **solder mask
expansion** setting.

**Solder paste relative clearance** allows setting a solder paste
clearance value as a percentage of the pad size rather than an absolute
distance value. If both relative and absolute clearances are specified,
they are added together to determine the solder paste aperture size.

**Pad connection to zones** controls whether the footprint’s pads will
have solid, thermal relief, or no connection to zones. Like the other
overrides, this one may be set for an individual pad or for an entire
footprint. The default setting for this control is **From zone
setting**, which uses the connection mode specified in the connection
zones' properties. This setting can be overridden for individual pads by
setting the pad’s connection mode to a value other than **From parent
footprint**.

##### Creating net ties

Footprints can act as net ties, where two separate nets are electrically
connected by copper. Connecting nets together would normally causes a
DRC error due to violating the clearance between two nets, but a
footprint can be configured to short nets without causing a DRC
violation. This can be used to connect multiple grounds at a specific
location, to make kelvin sense connections to a component, or for other
applications.

<figure>
<img src="images/net_tie_group.png" alt="net tie group" />
</figure>

Net ties connect two or more nets in one contiguous region of copper.
Each net in a net tie must have its own pad. Pads are not ordinarily
allowed to short to other pads; to allow pads to be shorted in net ties,
the shorting pads must be added to a **net tie group**. To create a net
tie group, add the pad numbers of the shorting pads to the **Net Ties**
table in the **Clearance Overrides and Settings** tab of the Footprint
Properties dialog. For example, to allow pads `1` and `2` to short in a
footprint, add a line to the table with the contents `1,2`.

After creating a net tie group, the specified pads are allowed to be
electrically shorted. Pads in net tie groups can be connected either by
directly overlapping the pads or by adding a copper shape that overlaps
both pads.

Footprints can contain multiple net tie groups. Each group can short two
or more nets, but every group must remain electrically separate from
other groups.

#### 3D models

The **3D Models** tab allows you to attach external 3D model files to a
footprint and view the footprint in three dimensions along with any
attached models.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_editor_properties_3dmodels.png"
alt="footprint editor properties 3dmodels" />
</figure>

The main part of the window is a 3D preview of the footprint and any
attached models. The buttons to the right of the preview let you enable
or disable an orthographic projection (![ortho
16](images/icons/ortho_16.png)), show or hide the PCB model (![axis3d
16](images/icons/axis3d_16.png)), align the view to one of the six
face-aligned perspectives (![axis3d left
16](images/icons/axis3d_left_16.png)), and refresh the view (![refresh
16](images/icons/refresh_16.png)). The bottom button (![options 3drender
16](images/icons/options_3drender_16.png)) lets you set the thickness of
the PCB in the preview.

The top of the dialog lets you attach external models. Each added model
will be shown in the footprint preview as well as in the full PCB 3D
view when the footprint is added to a board. Footprint models can be in
STEP, VRML, or [IDF](#idf-component-outlines) format. The models are
specified as paths to the model files, which can contain [path
variables](../kicad/kicad.xml#path-variables) such as `${KIPRJMOD}` or
`${KICAD9_3DMODEL_DIR}`. Click the **Configure Paths** button to
configure path variables. If there is a problem loading a model file
from the specified path, an icon in the leftmost column will indicate an
error.

<div class="note">

KiCad will automatically resolve versioned path variables from older
versions of KiCad to the value of the corresponding variable from the
current KiCad version, as long as the old variable is not explicitly
defined itself. For example, `${KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR}` will
automatically resolve to the value of `${KICAD9_FOOTPRINT_DIR}` if there
is no `KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR` variable defined.

</div>

<div class="note">

Many footprints in KiCad’s standard library do not yet have model files
created for them. However, these footprints may contain a path to a 3D
model that does not yet exist, in anticipation of the 3D model being
created in the future.

</div>

By default, models are added with their origin placed at the footprint’s
origin, with no offset, scaling, or rotation. Offset, scaling, and
rotation can be applied to a model using the controls to the left of the
preview canvas. The model’s opacity can be adjusted using the
**opacity** slider, and the model can be completely hidden by
deselecting the **show** checkbox in the rightmost column of the model
table.

### Embedding files in footprints

External files can be embedded within a footprint. Embedding a file
stores a copy of the file inside the footprint. The footprint can then
refer to the embedded copy of the file instead of the external file,
which makes the footprint more portable as it doesn’t rely on an
external file, although the footprint’s filesize is increased as a
result. In footprints this is especially useful for embedding 3D models.
Files embedded in a footprint are deduplicated when the footprint is
added to a board: if a file is embedded in a footprint, and multiple
instances of that footprint are added to the board, only one copy of the
file will be embedded, and all of the footprint instances will refer to
the same embedded file. Files embedded in a footprint cannot be referred
to in the parent board. File embedding is explained in more detail in
the [Board Setup documentation](#pcb-embedding-files).

<figure>
<img src="images/fp_embedded_files.png" alt="fp embedded files" />
</figure>

<div class="note">

You can add a 3D model to a footprint and embed it in one step. To do
so, add a 3D model in the **3D Models**, and enable the **Embed File**
checkbox in the file browser while choosing a model. This embeds the
file and automatically uses the embedded reference as the file path
instead of the path to the external file.

</div>

### Footprint pads

Pads are added to a footprint by clicking the ![pad
24](images/icons/pad_24.png) button in the right toolbar, then clicking
again in the desired location in the canvas. The tool continues adding
new pads each time you click on the canvas until you cancel the tool
(Esc).

New pads have their pad type set by the [footprint’s
type](#footprint-attributes), though you can change the pad type later.
New pads in SMD footprints are SMD by default, while pads in Through
Hole and Unspecified footprints are through hole. Each new pad has its
pad number incremented by 1 relative to the previous pad number.

#### Pad properties

You can edit a pad after adding it by opening the pad’s properties
dialog (E). These properties are also editable using the [Properties
Manager](#editing-object-properties).

##### General tab

The **General** tab of the pad properties dialog shows the physical
properties of the pad, including its geometry, shape, and layer
settings.

<figure>
<img src="images/pad_properties_general.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="pad properties general" />
</figure>

**Pad type:** this setting controls which features are enabled for the
pad:

- **SMD** pads are electrically-connected and have no hole. In other
  words, they exist on a single copper layer.

- **Through-hole** pads are electrically-connected and have a plated
  hole. The hole exists on every layer, and the copper pad exists on
  multiple layers (see **Copper layers** setting below).

- **Edge Connector** pads are SMD pads that are allowed to overlap the
  board outline on the `Edge.Cuts` layer.

- **NPTH, Mechanical** pads are non-plated through holes that do not
  have an electrical connection.

- **SMD Aperture** pads are pads that have no hole and no electrical
  connection. These can be used to add specific designs to a technical
  layer, for example a paste or solder mask aperture.

The **Copper layers** setting controls which copper layers will have a
shape associated with the pad.

For SMD pads, the options are `F.Cu` or `B.Cu`, controlling whether the
pad sits on the front or the back of the board *relative to the
footprint’s location*. In other words, if a pad is set to exist on
`B.Cu` in its properties, and the footprint is flipped to the back of
the board, *that pad will now exist on `F.Cu`, because it also has been
flipped*.

For through-hole pads, it is possible to remove the pad shape from
copper layers where the pad is not electrically connected to other
copper (tracks or filled zones). Setting the copper layers to
**connected layers only** will remove the pad shape from any unconnected
layers, and setting to **`F.Cu`, `B.Cu`, and connected layers** will
remove the pad shape from any internal unconnected layers. This can be
useful in dense board designs to increase the routable area on internal
layers.

The **Technical layers** checkboxes control which technical layers will
have an aperture added with the pad’s shape. By default, pads have
apertures on the paste and mask layers matching their copper layer.

<div class="note">

It is not possible to define a different pad shape or size on different
copper layers in the current version of KiCad.

</div>

The **Pad number** controls what the pad will be electrically connected
to in the board. A pad has the same net connection as the pin with the
same number in the corresponding schematic symbol.

Pad **Position X** and **Y** are the location of the center of the pad,
relative to the footprint’s origin.

**Pad shape** controls the basic shape of the pad. This can be
**circular**, **oval**, **rectangular**, **trapezoidal**, **rounded
rectangle**, **chamfered rectangle**, **chamfered with other corners
rounded**, **custom (circular base)**, or **custom (rectangular base)**.
Each pad shape has its own set of options; for example, rounded
rectangles have settings for **pad size X** and **Y**, **angle**,
**corner size**, and **corner radius**.

<div class="note">

The size of a pad can also be adjusted interactively in the canvas by
dragging the editing handles at the pad corners.

</div>

Through-hole and NPTH pads have a hole in addition to the pad itself.
The **hole shape** can be **circular** or **oval**, with corresponding
size controls. By default the pad is centered on the hole, but the pad
can be offset relative to the hole if the **offset shape from hole**
option is enabled (circular pads cannot be offset from the hole).

**Fabrication properties** are primarily used as metadata in Gerber X2
fabrication output, where the fabrication property is included as an
aperture attribute for each pad. Some properties also affect DRC. The
following fabrication properties are available:

- **BGA pad** can only be applied to SMD pads, and only affects Gerber
  X2 output.

- **Fiducial, local to footprint** and **fiducial, global to board**
  only affect Gerber X2 output.

- **Test point** can only be applied to SMD or through hole pads, can
  only be applied to pads on outer layers, and only affects Gerber X2
  output.

- Through hole pads with the **heatsink pad** property are allowed in
  SMD footprints (PTH pads without this property cause a DRC violation
  when they are used in SMD footprints). It also affects Gerber X2
  output.

- The **castellated pad** property is for pads that intentionally
  intersect the board edge such that they will be bisected when the
  board is manufactured. Pads with this property are allowed to
  intersect the board edge and still be routed (it is otherwise a DRC
  error for a pad to intersect the board edge, which makes routing
  impossible). In STEP exports, pads with this property are clipped to
  the board edge. This property also affects Gerber X2 output.

- Through hole pads with the **mechanical** property can be used in SMD
  footprints without causing a DRC violation. This can be used for
  mounting pads or other mechanical through hole pads in surface mount
  footprints. This is similar to the **heatsink pad** property, but does
  not affect Gerber X2 output.

- **None** is for pads for which none of the other fabrication
  properties apply. It has no effect.

**Specify pad to die length:** This setting allows a length to be
associated with this pad that will be added to the routed track length
by the track length tuning tools and the Net Inspector. This can be used
to specify internal bondwire lengths for more accurate length matching,
or in other situations where the electrical length of a net is longer
than the length of the routed tracks on the board.

##### Connections tab

The **Connections** tab contains settings for how pads connect to other
objects, including settings for teardrops, zone connections, and thermal
reliefs.

<figure>
<img src="images/pad_properties_connections.png"
alt="pad properties connections" />
</figure>

The Teardrops section contains settings controlling teardrop connections
between tracks and the pad, if teardrops are used. Teardrop settings are
explained in the [teardrop documentation](#editing-teardrops).

**Pad connection** controls whether the pad will have a solid, thermal
relief, or no connection to the zone. Like the other overrides, this one
may be set for an individual pad or for an entire footprint. The default
setting for this control is **From parent footprint**, and the default
footprint setting is to use the connection mode specified in the zone
properties.

**Zone knockout** controls the behavior of the zone filler when the pad
uses a custom shape rather than one of the default shapes. This can be
used to achieve different results when using thermal reliefs and custom
pad shapes.

**Relief gap** controls the length of the thermal spokes, or the gap
between the pad’s shape and the filled copper area of the zone. This
value is normally empty which will cause the relief gap to be inherited
from the connecting zone’s settings.

**Spoke width** controls the width of the spokes generated when the zone
connection mode is **Thermal Relief**. This value is normally empty
which will cause the spoke width to be inherited from the connecting
zone’s settings.

<div class="note">

Prior to KiCad version 9, a relief gap or spoke width of `0` caused that
value to be inherited. In KiCad 9 and later, a relief gap or spoke width
of `0` sets that value to `0`, while a blank value causes the value to
be inherited.

</div>

##### Clearance Overrides tab

The **Clearance Overrides** tab holds settings for pad-specific
overrides to board clearance and mask/paste expansion.

<figure>
<img src="images/pad_properties_overrides.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="pad properties overrides" />
</figure>

**Pad clearance** controls the minimum clearance between the pad and any
copper shape (tracks, vias, pads, zones) on a different net. This value
is normally empty which will cause the pad clearance to be inherited
from any clearance override set on the footprint, or the board’s design
rules and netclass rules if the footprint clearance is also empty.

<div class="note">

Prior to KiCad version 9, a pad clearance of `0` caused the pad
clearance value to be inherited. In KiCad 9 and later, a pad clearance
of `0` sets the clearance to `0`, while a blank pad clearance causes the
clearance to be inherited.

</div>

The aperture appearing on any technical layer will have the same shape
and size as the pad shape on the copper layer(s). In the PCB
manufacturing process, the manufacturer will often change the relative
size of mask and paste apertures relative to the copper pad size, but
since this size change is specific to a manufacturing process, most
manufacturers expect the design data to be provided with the apertures
set to the same size as the copper pads. For specific situations where
you need to oversize or undersize a technical layer aperture in the
design data, you can use the settings here.

**Solder mask expansion** controls the size difference between the pad
shape and the aperture shape on the F.Mask and B.Mask layers. A positive
number means the solder mask aperture will be larger than the copper
shape. This number is an inflation applied to all directions. For
example, a value of `0.1mm` here will cause the solder mask aperture to
be inflated by `0.1mm`, meaning that there will be an `0.1mm` border on
all sides of the pad and the solder mask opening will be `0.2mm` wider
than the pad when measured along a given axis.

**Solder paste absolute clearance** controls the size difference between
the pad shape and the aperture shape on the F.Paste and B.Paste layers.
Its behavior is otherwise identical to the behavior of the **solder mask
expansion** setting.

**Solder paste relative clearance** allows setting a solder paste
clearance value as a percentage of the pad size rather than an absolute
distance value. If both relative and absolute clearances are specified,
they are added together to determine the solder paste aperture size.

#### Working with multiple pads

When you place a new pad, the new pad’s properties are copied from the
**default pad properties**. Each time any pad is edited, the pad’s
updated properties are stored as the default pad properties, so that new
pads will match the properties of the most recently edited pad.

You can directly edit the default pad properties by selecting **Edit** →
**Default Pad Properties…​**, or choose an existing pad to represent the
default by right clicking the pad and choosing **Copy Pad Properties to
Default**. New pads will use that pad’s properties as their defaults
until a new default is selected, either by editing another pad, editing
the default pad properties, or manually copying a different pad’s
properties to the default.

There are several ways to update existing pads with the properties of
other pads. You can apply the default pad properties to an explicit
selection of pads by selecting the desired target pads, right clicking,
and choosing **Paste Default Pad Properties to Selected** from the right
click context menu. You can also update other pads with a selected pad’s
properties using **Push Default Pad Properties to Other Pads…​**, also in
the right click context menu.

<figure>
<img src="images/push_pad_properties.png" alt="push pad properties" />
</figure>

This tool has several options to filter which pads are targeted.

If **do not modify pads having a different shape** is selected, only
pads with the exact same shape properties as the selected pad will be
updated.

If **do not modify pads having different layers** is selected, only pads
on the same layer(s) as the selected pad will be updated.

If **do not modify pads having a different orientation** is selected,
only pads with the same orientation as the selected pad will be updated.

If **do not modify pads pads having a different type** is selected, only
pads with the same pad type as the selected pad will be updated.

If no options are selected, all pads in the footprint will be updated.

You can create an array of pads from a source pad by right clicking the
source pad and selecting **Create from Selection** → **Create Array…​**
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+T</span>). The basic functionality of this
tool is described in the [PCB Editor documentation](#creating-arrays).
For pads, however, there are additional options for controlling pad
numbering.

<figure>
<img src="images/create_array_pads_grid.png"
alt="create array pads grid" />
</figure>

For grid arrays, you can select a numbering direction, either
**horizontal, then vertical** or **vertical, then horizontal**. If
**reverse numbering on alternate rows/columns** is selected, the
direction of increasing pad numbers will alternate from one row/column
to the next.

The initial pad number in the array can either be the first unused pad
number in the footprint (**use first free number**) or the specified
**pad numbering start** value. After the first number, the pad numbering
can either be **continuous** (1, 2, 3, …​) or **coordinate** based, in
other words, dependent on both the row and column (A1, A2, …​, B1, …​). In
addition to the initial pad number (**pad numbering start**), you can
specify a numbering step (**pad numbering skip**). For coordinate-based
numbering, you can configure separate starting numbers and steps for
each axis. You can select whether pad numbers use decimal digits (0-9),
hexadecimal digits (0-F), the full alphabet, or the alphabet excepting
certain ambiguous letters (I, O, S, Q, X, and Z).

Finally, you can quickly renumber existing pads using the Renumber Pads
tool (**Edit** → **Renumber Pads…​**).

<figure>
<img src="images/renumber_pads.png" alt="renumber pads" />
</figure>

The tool has several options. Pads will be renumbered starting at the
selected **first pad number**, and each subsequent pad will have its
number incremented by the **numbering step**. You can also choose an
optional **pad name prefix** which will be inserted before of the
incrementing part of each pad number.

Once you click **OK**, you will be prompted to click on a pad, which
will be assigned a new pad number based on the selected initial pad
number and prefix. You can keep clicking on pads to assign them the next
number in the sequence based on the selected numbering step. Double
click on a pad to renumber that pad and end the sequence, or press Esc
to discard the changes.

#### Custom pad shapes

For some footprints, the built-in pad shapes (round, rectangular, etc.)
may not be sufficient. In these cases you can construct custom pads with
arbitrary shapes using **Pad Edit Mode**. This mode lets you combine a
basic pad with graphic shapes to build a new pad out of the compound
shape.

To build a custom pad, first add a regular pad using the pad tool (![pad
24](images/icons/pad_24.png) button). This base pad will become the
custom pad’s anchor or snapping point, so be sure to place the pad in
the exact location where you want tracks to attach to the pad. The shape
and size of the pad do not matter, but the hole, if any, will remain in
the final custom pad. In other words, a surface mount base pad will
result in a surface mount custom pad, and a through hole base pad will
result in a through hole custom pad. The custom pad’s number will be
inherited from the base pad.

Next, enter Pad Edit Mode by selecting the base pad, right-clicking, and
selecting **Edit Pad as Graphic Shapes**
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+E</span>). Add graphic shapes as
appropriate to create the desired pad shape. Shapes touching the base
pad will be unioned together with the base pad to create the final pad
shape.

You can exit Pad Edit Mode by right-clicking and selecting **Finish Pad
Edit**, or pressing <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+E</span> again. When you
exit pad edit mode, all shapes that touch the base pad will be combined
with the pad. For example, when editing a surface mount pad on `F.Cu`,
any shapes that are on `F.Cu` and touch the base pad will become part of
the custom pad. Any shapes that do not overlap the base pad, or that are
on a different layer, will remain separate. If the base pad is a through
hole pad, overlapping shapes on `F.Cu` will be combined in the custom
pad. Because through hole pads have the same pad shape on all copper
layers, this shape will become part of the custom pad on all copper
layers, not just `F.Cu`. For convenience, Pad Edit Mode dims the color
of other pads and all shapes that are not contiguous with the base pad
so that you can see which shapes will be included in the custom pad and
which will not.

Custom pads can only contain a single base pad. Any additional pads that
touch the base pad or the contiguous graphics, whether they have the
same or different pad numbers as the base pad, will remain separate pads
after the shapes are combined into the custom pad.

<div class="note">

If you would like to add multiple anchors (snapping points) to a custom
pad, you can add additional separate pads on top of the custom pad.
Create the custom pad as normal, containing the first snapping point,
then add additional pads with the same number and place them overlapping
the custom pad in the desired snapping locations. They will remain
distinct pads and will not be combined with the custom pad, but they
will act as additional pad anchors and will be electrically connected to
the custom pad.

</div>

To modify an existing custom pad, select it and enter Pad Edit Mode
again. You can then continue to edit the component shapes to adjust the
pad shape, or change the position of the base pad to adjust the pad
anchor.

KiCad automatically chooses a size and location for showing the pad
number over the pad. Particularly for unusually shaped pads, the
automatically determined size and location may not be optimal. In these
cases, you can manually specify a region in which KiCad should draw the
pad number by adding a pad **number box** primitive. To add a number
box, enter Pad Edit Mode and add a rectangular shape. In the Properties
Manager for the rectangle, check the **Number Box** checkbox. The
rectangle will then be shown as a wireframe, and when you exit Pad Edit
Mode it will be used to draw the pad number.

In the board, KiCad will automatically add thermal spokes when
connecting the pad to a zone. The thermal spoke settings are determined
by the pad, footprint, and zone settings, and the thermal spokes by
default connect to the pad anchor. You can override the default thermal
spoke placement by adding **thermal relief templates** to the custom
pad. To add a thermal relief template, enter Pad Edit Mode and add a
line shape. In the Properties Manager for the line, check the **Thermal
Relief Template** checkbox. In Pad Edit Mode, the line will then be
shown as a wireframe, and it will not be shown outside of pad edit mode.
If any thermal relief templates are present in the pad, KiCad will not
automatically add additional spokes when filling zones; spokes will only
be placed where there are thermal relief templates defined in the pad.
Thermal relief templates only determine the spoke location: spoke width
and relief gap are still defined in the pad, footprint, and/or zone
properties, as normal.

### Footprint graphics and text

Footprints can contain graphic shapes, text, and dimensions. These
objects can be placed on nonphysical layers, like `F.Fab` or
`User.Drawings`, or they can be placed on layers that will be part of
the manufactured circuit board, such as `Edge.Cuts` or a silkscreen,
soldermask, or copper layer. Objects on copper layers can make
electrical connections.

Closed shapes on a footprint’s `F.Courtyard` and `B.Courtyard` layers
will form the footprint’s front and back courtyard, respectively. A
courtyard defines the physical extents of a footprint and limits where
footprints are allowed to be placed in relation to other footprints. If
a footprint’s courtyard overlaps another footprint’s courtyard, a DRC
violation will be generated.

Shapes on a footprint’s `Edge.Cuts` layer will correspond to board edges
on any PCB that includes the footprint. Closed shapes will result in
cutouts, while unclosed shapes will result in unclosed edges. Unclosed
edges must be closed in the full board design.

The buttons on the right toolbar can be used to create:

- Lines (![add line 24](images/icons/add_line_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+L</span>)

- Arcs (![add arc 24](images/icons/add_arc_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+A</span>)

- Bezier curves (![add bezier 24](images/icons/add_bezier_24.png),
  default hotkey <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+B</span>)

- Rectangles (![add rectangle 24](images/icons/add_rectangle_24.png))

- Circles (![add circle 24](images/icons/add_circle_24.png), default
  hotkey <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+C</span>)

- Polygons (![add graphical polygon
  24](images/icons/add_graphical_polygon_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+P</span>)

- Text (![text 24](images/icons/text_24.png), default hotkey
  <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+T</span>)

- Textboxes (![add textbox 24](images/icons/add_textbox_24.png))

- Tables (![table 24](images/icons/table_24.png))

- Dimensions (![add aligned dimension
  24](images/icons/add_aligned_dimension_24.png)), of which several
  types are available

<div class="note">

You can customize the default style of newly-created text and shape
objects in **Preferences** → **Footprint Editor** → **Default Values**.

</div>

Graphical objects and their properties are described in more detail in
the [PCB Editor documentation](#pcb-graphical-objects).

#### Bulk editing footprint text and graphics

Properties of text and graphics can be edited in bulk using the **Edit
Text and Graphics Properties** dialog (**Edit** → **Edit Text & Graphic
Properties…​**).

<figure>
<img src="images/edit_text_and_graphics_properties_footprint.png"
alt="edit text and graphics properties footprint" />
</figure>

This dialog is described in more detail in the [PCB Editor
documentation](#pcbnew-edit-text-and-graphics-properties).

#### Cleaning up footprint graphics

There is a dedicated tool for performing common cleanup operations on
graphics, which is run via **Tools** → **Cleanup Graphics…​**.

<figure>
<img src="images/cleanup_graphics_footprint.png"
alt="cleanup graphics footprint" />
</figure>

The following cleanup actions are available and will be performed when
selected:

**Merge lines into rectangles:** combines individual graphic lines that
together form a rectangle into a single rectangle shape object.

**Delete redundant graphics:** deletes graphics objects that are
duplicated or degenerate.

**Merge overlapping graphics into pads:** merges graphic copper shapes
that overlap pads into a [custom pad](#custom-pad-shapes).

Any changes that will be applied to the footprint are displayed at the
bottom of the dialog. They are not applied until you press the **Update
Footprint** button.

### Rule areas

Rule areas, also known as keepouts, are footprint regions that can have
specific DRC rules defined for them. Some basic rules are available that
will raise DRC errors if certain types of objects are within the bounds
of the rule area, but rule areas can also be used together with [custom
DRC rules](#custom-design-rules) to define complex DRC behavior that
only applies within the rule area. A rule area in a footprint takes
effect when the footprint is added to the board.

You can add a rule area by clicking the ![add keepout area
24](images/icons/add_keepout_area_24.png) button on the right toolbar
(<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Shift+K</span>). Click on the canvas to
place the first corner, which will show the Rule Area Properties dialog.
After configuring the rule area appropriately, press **OK** to continue
placing corners of the rule area. The rule area shape can be an
arbitrary polygon; click on the starting corner or double click to
finish placing the rule area.

Rule areas are described in more detail in the [PCB
editor](#pcb-rule-areas) documentation.

### Reference images

Just like in the PCB Editor, you can use reference images in the
Footprint Editor to assist with your footprint designs. Footprint
reference images are only shown in the Footprint Editor: they are not
shown in the PCB Editor when a footprint is added to a board, and they
do not appear in any fabrication outputs.

To add a reference image, use the ![image 24](images/icons/image_24.png)
button on the right toolbar and select the desired reference image file.

Reference images are described in more detail in the [PCB Editor
documentation](#pcb-reference-images).

### Footprint wizards

KiCad provides a set of footprint wizards that can be used to create
some common kinds of footprints based on a set of parameters. Wizards
for the following types of footprints are provided:

- BGA packages

- QFN packages

- QFP packages

- SOIC, MSOP, SSOP, TSSOP, etc. packages

- SIP and DIP packages

- ZIP packages

- ZOIC packages

- FPC connectors

- Micromatch SMD connectors

- Circular pad arrays

- Touch sliders

- Mutual capacitance touch buttons

- USS-39 barcodes

- QR codes

To create a footprint using a footprint wizard, click the ![module
wizard 24](images/icons/module_wizard_24.png) button and choose a
footprint type from the list that appears.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_wizard.png" alt="footprint wizard" />
</figure>

In the window that appears, fill out the parameters as appropriate. When
the parameters are correctly filled out, press the ![export footprint
names 24](images/icons/export_footprint_names_24.png) button to transfer
the generated footprint back into the footprint editor. Then you can
make additional manual modifications and save the footprint as normal.

In addition to the set of footprint wizards that KiCad provides, you can
also create your own. For more information about creating new footprint
wizards, see the [Scripting section](#creating-footprint-wizards) of the
Advanced Topics chapter.

### Checking footprints

The Footprint Editor can check for common issues in your footprints. Run
the footprint checker using the ![erc 24](images/icons/erc_24.png)
button in the top toolbar.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_checker.png" alt="footprint checker" />
</figure>

Any footprint issues that are detected are listed in the dialog and
displayed with arrow indicators in the editing canvas. Clicking on an
issue in the dialog will focus on the issue in the canvas.

The footprint checker checks for:

- Malformed or missing courtyards

- Pads that don’t match the footprint’s type: footprints without any
  through hole pads should be set to the surface mount footprint type

- Through hole pads without a hole

- Plated through hole pads not on any copper layers

- Plated through hole pads without a copper annulus

- Plated through hole pads with a hole that isn’t fully within the pad

- Surface mount pads on both the front and back

- Surface mount pads with mismatched copper and paste/mask layers (front
  copper and back paste/mask, or vice versa)

- Pads co-located with or too close to other holes

- Collisions between silkscreen and solder mask openings

- Pads that short to other pads outside of net tie groups

- Nonexistent pads in net tie groups

- Pads in that appear in multiple net tie groups

## Browsing footprint libraries

The Footprint Library Browser allows you to quickly examine the contents
of footprint libraries. The Footprint Library Viewer can be accessed by
clicking ![Library viewer icon](images/icons/library_browser_24.png)
icon on the main Board Editor toolbar or with **View** → **Footprint
Library Browser**.

To examine the contents of a library, select a library from the list in
the left hand pane. All footprints in the selected library will appear
in the second pane. Select a footprint name to view the footprint.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_library_browser.png" style="width:95.0%"
alt="Footprint Library Browser" />
</figure>

Double clicking the name of a footprint or using the ![Insert footprint
in board icon](images/icons/insert_module_board_24.png) button adds the
footprint to the board.

The top toolbar contains the following commands:

|                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                  |
