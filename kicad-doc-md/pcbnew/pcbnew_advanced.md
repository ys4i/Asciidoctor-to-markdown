## Configuration and Customization

The KiCad PCB Editor has a variety of preferences that can be configured
through the Preferences dialog. Like all parts of KiCad, the preferences
for the PCB Editor are stored in the user configuration directory and
are independent between KiCad minor versions to allow multiple versions
to run side-by-side with independent preferences.

The first sections of the Preferences dialog (Common, Mouse and
Touchpad, and Hotkeys) are shared between all KiCad programs. These
sections are described in detail in the KiCad manual under the "Common
preferences" section.

### Display options

alt="pcbnew preferences display" />
</figure>

**Rendering Engine:** Controls if Accelerated graphics or Fallback
graphics are used.

**Grid style:** Controls how the alignment grid is drawn.

**Grid thickness:** Controls how thick grid lines or dots are drawn.

**Min grid spacing:** Controls the minimum distance, in pixels, between
two grid lines. Grid lines that violate this minimum spacing will not be
drawn, regardless of the current grid setting.

**Snap to grid:** Controls when drawing and editing operations will be
snapped to coordinates on the active grid. "Always" will enable snapping
even when the grid is hidden; "When grid shown" will enable snapping
only when the grid is visible.

<div class="note">

Grid snapping can be temporarily disabled by holding down Ctrl.

</div>

**Cursor shape:** Controls whether the editing cursor is drawn as a
small crosshair or a full-screen crosshair (a set of lines covering the
entire drawing canvas). The editing cursor shows where the next drawing
or editing action will occur and will be snapped to a grid location if
snapping is enabled.

**Always show crosshairs:** Controls whether the editing cursor is shown
all the time or only when an editing or drawing tool is active.

**Net names:** Controls whether or not net name labels are drawn on
copper objects. These labels are guides for editing only and do not
appear in fabrication outputs.

**Show pad numbers:** Controls whether or not pad number labels are
drawn on footprint pads.

**Show pad \<no net\> indicator:** Controls whether or not pads with no
net are indicated with a special marker.

**Track clearance:** Controls whether or not clearance outlines around
tracks and vias are shown. Clearance outlines are shown as thin shapes
around objects that indicate the minimum clearance to other objects, as
defined by constraints and design rules.

**Show pad clearance:** Controls whether or not clearance outlines
around pads are shown.

**Center view on cross-probed items:** When the Schematic and PCB
Editors are both running, controls whether clicking a component or pin
in Eeschema will center the PCB Editor view on the corresponding
footprint or pad.

**Zoom to fit cross-probed items:** Controls whether the view will be
zoomed to show a cross-probed footprint or pad.

**Highlight cross-probed nets:** Controls whether or not nets
highlighted in Eeschema will be highlighted in the PCB Editor when the
highlight tool is activated in both tools.

### Editing options

<figure>

alt="pcbnew preferences editing" />
</figure>

**Flip board items L/R:** Controls the direction board items will be
flipped when moving them between the top and bottom layers. When
checked, items are flipped Left-to-Right (about the Vertical axis); when
unchecked, items are flipped Top-to-Bottom (about the Horizontal axis).

**Step for rotate commands:** Controls how far the selected object(s)
will be rotated each time the Rotate command is used.

**Allow free pads:** Controls whether or not the pads of footprints can
be unlocked and edited or moved separately from the footprint.

**Magnetic points:** This section controls object snapping, also called
magnetic points. Object snapping takes precedence over grid snapping
when it is enabled. Object snapping only works to objects on the active
layer. Hold Shift to temporarily disable object snapping.

**Snap to pads:** Controls when the editing cursor will snap to pad
origins.

**Snap to tracks:** Controls when the editing cursor will snap to track
segment endpoints.

**Snap to graphics:** Controls when the editing cursor will snap to
graphic shape points.

**Always show selected ratsnest:** When enabled, the ratsnest for a
selected footprint will always be shown even if the global ratsnest is
hidden.

**Show ratsnest with curved lines:** Controls whether ratsnest lines are
drawn straight or curved.

**Mouse drag track behavior:** Controls the action that will occur when
you drag a track segment with the mouse: "Move" will move the track
segment independent of any others. "Drag (45 degree mode)" will invoke
the push-and-shove router to drag the track, respecting design rules and
keeping other track segments attached. "Drag (free angle)" will move the
nearest corner of the track segment, highlighting collisions with other
objects but not moving them out of the way.

**Limit actions to 45 degrees from start** Controls whether lines drawn
with the graphic drawing tools can take on any angle. Note that this
only affects drawing new lines: lines can be edited to take on any
angle.

**Show page limits:** Controls whether or not the page boundary is drawn
as a rectangle.

**Refill zones after Zone Properties dialog:** Controls whether or not
zones are automatically refilled after editing the properties of any
zone. This may be disabled on complicated designs or slower computers to
improve responsiveness.

### Colors

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_preferences_colors.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="pcbnew preferences colors" />
</figure>

KiCad supports switching between different color themes to match your
preferences. Kicad 9.0 comes with two built-in color themes: "KiCad
Default" is a new theme designed to have good contrast and balance for
most cases and is the default for new installations. "KiCad Classic" is
the default theme from KiCad 5.1 and earlier versions. Neither of these
built-in themes can be modified, but you can create new themes to
customize the look of KiCad as well as install themes made by other
users.

Color themes are stored in JSON files located in the `colors`
subdirectory of the KiCad configuration directory. The "Open Theme
Folder" button will open this location in your system file manager,
making it easy to manage your installed themes. To install a new theme,
place it in this folder and restart KiCad. The new theme will be
available from the drop-down list of color themes if the file is a valid
color theme file.

To create a new color theme, choose New Theme…​ from the drop-down list
of color themes. Enter a name for your theme and then begin editing
colors. The colors in the new theme will be copied from whatever theme
was selected before you created the new theme.

To change a color, double-click or middle-click the color swatch in the
list. The "Reset to Default" button will reset that color to its
corresponding entry in the "KiCad Default" color theme.

Color themes are saved automatically; all changes are reflected
immediately when you close the Preferences dialog. The window on the
right side of the dialog shows a preview of how the selected theme will
look.

### Action plugins

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_preferences_action_plugins.png"
style="width:50.0%" alt="pcbnew preferences action plugins" />
</figure>

The KiCad PCB editor supports plugins written in Python that can perform
actions on the board being edited. These plugins can be installed using
the built-in Plugin and Content Manager (see the KiCad chapter for
details) or by placing the plugin files inside the user plugins
directory. See the Scripting section below for details.

Each plugin that is detected will be shown in a row on this preferences
page. Plugins may show a button on the top toolbar of the PCB editor. If
the "Show button" control is unchecked for a plugin, it may still be
accessed from the Tools \> External Plugins menu.

The arrow controls at the bottom of the list allow changing the order
that the plugins appear in the toolbar and menu. The folder button will
launch a file explorer to the plugin folder, to make installing new
plugins easier. The refresh button will scan the plugin folder for any
new or removed plugins and update the list.

### Origin & axes

<figure>
<img src="images/pcbnew_preferences_origin_axes.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="pcbnew preferences origin axes" />
</figure>

**Display origin:** Determines which coordinate origin is used for
coordinate display in the editing canvas. The page origin is fixed at
the corner of the page. The drill/place file origin and the grid origin
can be moved by the user.

**X axis:** Controls whether X-coordinates increase to the right or to
the left.

**Y axis:** Controls whether Y-coordinates increase upwards or
downwards.

## Text variables

KiCad supports text variables, which allow you to substitute the
variable name with a defined text string. This substitution happens
anywhere the variable name is used inside the variable replacement
syntax of `${VARIABLENAME}`.

You can define project text variables in the
[schematic](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#schematic-setup-text-variables) or
[board setup](#board-setup-text-variables) dialogs. Project text
variables are defined for the whole project, so a project text variable
defined in the Schematic Editor can also be used in the Board Editor.

There are also a number of built-in system text variables. System text
variables may be available in some contexts and not others. The
following variables can be used in PCB text, footprint text, footprint
fields, and drawing sheet fields. There are also a number of [variables
that can be used in the Schematic
Editor](../eeschema/eeschema.xml#text-variables).

## <span id="custom_design_rules"></span>Custom design rules

KiCad’s custom design rule system allows creating design rules that are
more specific than the generic rules available in the Constraints page
of the Board Setup dialog. Custom design rules have many applications,
but in general they are used to apply certain rules to a portion of the
board, such as a specific net or net class, a specific area, or a
specific footprint.

Custom design rules are stored in a separate file with the extension
`kicad_dru`. This file is created automatically when you start adding
custom rules to a project. If you are using custom rules in your
project, make sure to save the `kicad_dru` file along with the
`kicad_pcb` and `kicad_pro` files when making backups or committing to a
version control system.

<div class="note">

The `kicad_dru` file is managed automatically by KiCad and should not be
edited with an external text editor. Always use the Custom Rules page of
the Board Setup dialog to edit custom design rules.

</div>

### The Custom Rules editor

The custom rules editor is located in the Board Setup dialog and
provides a text editor for entering custom rules, a syntax checker that
will test your custom rules and note any errors, and a syntax help
dialog that contains a quick reference to the custom rules language and
some example rules.

The custom rules editor also provides context-sensitive autocomplete to
suggest valid keywords and properties. The autocomplete suggestion menu
appears automatically, but it can also be opened manually by pressing
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+Space</span>.

It is a good idea to use the **Check rule syntax** button after editing
custom rules to make sure there are no syntax errors. Any errors in the
custom rules will prevent the design rule checker from running.

### Custom rule syntax

The custom design rule language is based on s-expressions and allows you
to create design constraints that are not possible with the built-in
constraints. Each design rule generally contains a **condition**
defining what objects to match and a **constraint** defining the rule to
be applied to the matched objects.

The language uses parentheses (`(` and `)`) to define clauses of related
keywords and values. Parentheses must always be matched: for every `(`
there must be a matching `)`. Inside a clause, keywords and values are
separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newlines). By convention, a
single space is used, but any number of whitespace characters between
keywords and values is acceptable. In places where text strings are
valid, strings without any whitespace may be quoted with `"` or `'`, or
unquoted. Strings that contain whitespace must always be quoted.
Newlines cannot be used within a quoted string. Where nested quotes are
required, a single level of nesting is possible by using `"` for the
outer quote character and `'` for the inner (or vice versa). Newlines
between clauses are not required, but are typically used in examples for
clarity.

In the syntax descriptions below, items in `<angle brackets>` represent
keywords or values that must be present and items in `[square brackets]`
represent keywords or values that are optional or only sometimes
required.

The Custom Rules file must start with a version header defining the
version of the rules language. As of KiCad 9.0, the version is `1`. The
syntax of the version header is `(version <number>)`. So in KiCad 9.0
the header should read:

    (version 1)

After the version header, you can enter any number of rules. Rules are
evaluated in reverse order, meaning the last rule in the file is checked
first. Once a matching rule is found for a given set objects being
tested, no further rules will be checked. In practice, this means that
more specific rules should be later in the file, so that they are
evaluated before more general rules.

For example, if you create one rule that limits the minimum clearance
between tracks in the net `HV` and tracks in any other net and a second
rule that limits the minimum clearance for all objects inside a certain
rule area, make sure the first rule appears later in the custom rules
file than the second rule. Otherwise tracks in the `HV` net could have
the wrong clearance if they fall inside the rule area.

Each rule must have a name and one or more `constraint` clauses. The
name can be any string and is used to refer to the rule in DRC reports.
The `constraint` defines the behavior of the rule. Rules may also have a
`condition` clause that determines which objects should have the rule
applied, an optional `layer` clause which specifies which board layers
the rule applies to, and an optional `severity` clause which specifies
the severity of the resulting DRC violation.

    (rule <name>
        [(severity <severity>)]
        [(layer <layer_name>)]
        [(condition <expression>)]
        (constraint <constraint_type> [constraint_arguments]))

The custom rules file may also include comments to describe rules.
Comments are denoted by any line that begins with the `#` character (not
including whitespace). You can press
<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+/</span> to comment or uncomment lines
automatically.

    # Clearance for 400V nets to anything else
    (rule HV
        (condition "A.hasNetclass('HV')")
        (constraint clearance (min 1.5mm)))

#### Layer Clause

The `layer` clause determines which layers the rule will work on. While
the layer of objects can be tested in the `condition` clause as
described below, using the `layer` clause is more efficient.

The value in the `layer` clause can be any board layer name, or the
shortcut keywords `outer` to match the front and back copper layers
(`F.Cu` and `B.Cu`) and `inner` to match any internal copper layers.

If the `layer` clause is omitted, the rule will apply to all layers.

Some examples:

    # Do not allow footprints on back layer (no condition clause means this rule always applies)
    (rule "Top side footprints only"
        (layer B.Cu)
        (constraint disallow footprint))

    # This rule does the same thing, but is less efficient
    (rule "Top side footprints only"
        (condition "A.Layer == 'B.Cu'")
        (constraint disallow footprint))

    # Larger clearance on outer layers (inner layer clearance set by board minimum clearance)
    (rule "clearance_outer"
        (layer outer)
        (constraint clearance (min 0.25mm)))

#### Severity Clause

The `severity` clause sets the DRC violation severity whenever the rule
is violated.

Possible values are `error`, `warning`, `ignore`, and `exclusion`.
Ignored rules are not observed by the interactive router and violations
are not shown in the DRC dialog. However, ignored rules are evaluated
for matching and therefore can still override earlier rules. Errors,
warnings, and excluded rules are all observed by the interactive router,
and violations are displayed in the DRC dialog when the appropriate
filters are selected.

<div class="warning">

Setting a rule’s severity to `ignore` does not disable the rule; only
the effects of the rule are disabled. The rule is still evaluated and
can still override previous rules.

</div>

#### Condition Clauses

The `condition` clause determines which objects which objects the rule
applies to. If a rule has a condition clause, the rule will apply to any
objects that match the condition. If a rule does not have any condition
clauses, it will apply unconditionally.

The rule **condition** is an expression contained inside a text string
(and therefore usually surrounded by quotes in order to allow whitespace
for clarity). The expression is evaluated against each pair of objects
that is being tested by the design rule checker. For example, when
checking for clearance between copper objects, each copper object (track
segment, pad, via, etc.) on each net is checked against other copper
objects on other nets. If a custom rule exists where the expression
matches the two given copper objects and the constraint defines a copper
clearance, this custom rule could be used to determine the required
clearance between the two objects.

The objects being tested are referred to as `A` and `B` in the
expression language. The order of the two objects is not important
because the design rule checker will test both possible orderings. For
example, you can write a rule that assumes that `A` is a track and `B`
is a via. There are some expression functions that test both objects
together; these use `AB` as the object name.

The expression in a condition must resolve to a boolean value (true or
false). If the expression resolves to true, the rule is applied to the
given objects.

Each object being tested has **properties** that can be compared, as
well as **functions** that can be used to perform certain tests. The
syntax for using properties and functions is `<object>.<property>` and
`<object>.<function>([arguments])` respectively.

<div class="note">

When you type `<object>.` in the text editor (`A.`, `B.`, or `AB.`), an
autocomplete list will open that contains all the object properties that
can be used.

</div>

The object properties and functions are compared using **boolean** and
**relational operators** to result in a boolean expression. The
following operators are supported:

|           |                                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `==`      | Equal to                               |
| `!=`      | Not equal to                           |
| `>`, `>=` | Greater than, greater than or equal to |
| `<`, `<=` | Less than, less than or equal to       |
| `&&`      | And                                    |
| `||`      | Or                                     |
| `!`       | Not (unary)                            |

For example, `A.NetName == 'VDD'` will apply to any objects that are
part of the "VDD" net and `A.NetName != B.NetName` will apply to any
objects that have different net names. Parentheses can be used to
clarify the order of operations in complex expressions but they are not
required. All the boolean operators have the same precedence and are
evaluated in order from left to right.

To test a boolean property, evaluate the property itself, without
comparing it to a boolean literal like `true` or `false` (which don’t
exist in the DRC rules language). For example, to test if a footprint’s
boolean `Do_not_populate` property is set, the boolean expression
`A.Do_not_populate` by itself is sufficient. It will resolve to a true
value if the footprint’s DNP attribute is set, and a false value
otherwise. To check if a boolean is false, use the `!` operator (unary
not): `!A.Do_not_populate` will resolve to a true value if the DNP
attribute is unset, and a false value otherwise.

Some properties represent a physical measurement, such as a size, angle,
length, position, etc. On these properties, **unit suffixes** can be
used in the custom rules language to specify what units are being used.
If no unit suffix is used, the internal representation of the property
will be used instead (nanometers for distances and degrees for most
angles). The following suffixes are supported:

|             |                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `mm`        | Millimeters                   |
| `mil`, `th` | Thousandths of an inch (mils) |
| `in`, `"`   | Inches                        |
| `deg`       | Degrees                       |
| `rad`       | Radians                       |

<div class="note">

The units used in custom design rules are independent of the display
units in the PCB editor.

</div>

Numeric conditions can use simple math expressions, for example
`(condition "A.Hole_Size_X == 1.0mm + 0.1mm")`.

#### Constraint Clauses

The `constraint` clause of the rule defines the behavior of the rule on
the objects that are matched by the condition. Each constraint clause
has a **constraint type** and one or more arguments that set the
behavior of the constraint. A single rule may have multiple constraint
clauses, in order to set multiple constraints (for example, `clearance`
and `track_width`) for objects that match the same rule conditions.

Many constraints take arguments that specify a physical measurement or
quantity. These constraints support minimum, optimal, and maximum value
specification (abbreviated "min/opt/max"). The **minimum** and
**maximum** values are used for design rule checking: if the actual
value is less than the minimum or is greater than the maximum value in
the constraint, a DRC error is created. The **optimal** value is only
used for some constraints, and informs KiCad of a "best" value to use by
default. For example, the optimal `diff_pair_gap` is used by the router
when placing new differential pairs. No errors will be created if the
differential pair is later modified such that the gap between the pair
is different from the optimal value, as long as the gap is between the
minimum and maximum values (if these are specified). In all cases where
a min/opt/max value is accepted, any or all of the minimum, optimal, and
maximum value can be specified.

Min/opt/max values are specified as `(min <value>)`, `(opt <value>)`,
and `(max <value>)`. For example, a track width constraint may be
written as
`(constraint track_width (min 0.5mm) (opt 0.5mm) (max 1.0mm))` or simply
`(constraint track_width (min 0.5mm))` if only the minimum width is to
be constrained.

Numeric constraint values can use simple math expressions, for example
`(constraint clearance (min 0.5mm + 0.1mm))`.

#### Common Properties

These properties apply to all PCB objects.

| Property     | Data type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Layer`      | string    | The board layer on which the object exists. For objects that exist on more than one layer, this property will return the first layer (for example, `F.Cu` for most through-hole pads/vias).                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Locked`     | boolean   | True if the object is locked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Parent`     | string    | Returns the unique identifier of the parent object of this object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Position_X` | dimension | The position of the object’s origin in the X-axis. Note that the origin of an object is not always the same as the center of the object’s bounding box. For example, the origin of a footprint is the location of the (0, 0) coordinate of that footprint in the footprint editor, but the footprint may have been designed such that this location is not in the center of the courtyard shape. |
| `Position_Y` | dimension | The position of the object’s origin in the Y-axis. Note that KiCad always uses Y-coordinates that increase from the top to bottom of the screen internally, even if you have configured your settings to show the Y-coordinates increasing from bottom to top.                                                                                                                                   |
| `Type`       | string    | One of "Bitmap", "Dimension", "Footprint", "Graphic", "Group", "Leader", "Pad", "Target", "Text", "Text Box", "Track", "Via", or "Zone".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

<p>Note that this list may include the <code>Default</code> net class,

because the <code>Default</code> net class provides fallback properties
and design rules for any properties not defined by explicit net classes.

<p>In an expression, an object’s <code>NetClass</code> property and a
net class string are equal to each other if the string matches any of
the net classes in the list, or if the string matches the full ordered

true:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>A.NetClass == 'HV'</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>A.NetClass == 'Default'</code></p></li>

</ul>
<p>You can also check if a copper object is a member of a particular net
class, regardless of any other net classes it may be a part of, using

the footprint. This is an alphabetically ordered, comma delimited list
where a footprint has multiple component classes assigned.</p>
<p>In an expression, a footprint’s <code>Component_Class</code> property
and a component class string are equal to each other if the string
matches any of the component classes in the list, or if the string
matches the full ordered list. For example, if a footprint belongs to
the <code>Connector</code> and <code>HV</code> component classes in that
order, all of the following expressions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>A.Component_Class == 'Connector'</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>A.Component_Class == 'HV'</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>A.Component_Class == 'Connector,HV'</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following expressions are false, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>A.Component_Class == 'LV'</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>A.Component_Class == 'Connector,LV'</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>A.Component_Class == 'HV,Connector'</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while <code>Component_Class</code> is a footprint property,
footprint children, such as pads or graphics, are considered to be
members of any component class that their parent footprint is a member
of. For example, if a footprint is has the component class
<code>HV</code>, the condition <code>A.Component_Class == 'HV'</code> is
true both for the footprint as well as for its pads and other
children.</p>
<p>You can also check if an object is part of a footprint with a
specific component class using the
<code>memberOfFootprint('${Class:x}')</code> function.</p></td>

## Scripting

Scripting allows you to automate tasks within KiCad using the
[Python](https://www.python.org/) language. KiCad provides an API for
editing PCBs that can be used interactively or in standalone scripts.
Board Editor scripts can be organized as "action plugins", which are
displayed as icons in the top toolbar of the Board Editor. There is also
a separate Footprint Wizard API that can be used to create footprint
creation plugins for the Footprint Editor.

This manual covers general scripting concepts for the Board Editor’s
`pcbnew` API as well as for the footprint wizard API. Users wishing to
write or modify scripts should also use the Doxygen documentation for
these APIs located at
<https://docs.kicad.org/doxygen-python-nightly/namespaces.html>.

KiCad 6 or newer requires Python 3 for scripting support. Python 2 is no
longer supported.

### Using the scripting console

The PCB Editor comes with a built-in Python console that can be used to
inspect and interact with the board. To launch the console, use the
![Scripting console icon](images/icons/py_script_24.png) button in the
top toolbar. The PCB Editor Python API is not automatically loaded, so
to load it, type `import pcbnew` into the console. The command
`pcbnew.GetBoard()` will then return a reference to the board currently
loaded in the PCB Editor, which can be inspected and modified through
the console.

### Python script locations

Plugin scripts (PCB action plugins and footprint wizards) can be
installed automatically using the Plugin and Content Manager (PCM), or
manually by copying the plugin to a folder. Manually installed plugins
should each be in their own folder within the `plugins` folder. The
location of the `plugins` folder is by default:

| Platform | Path                                           |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Linx     | `~/.local/share/kicad/9.0/scripting/plugins`   |
| macOS    | `~/Documents/KiCad/9.0/scripting/plugins`      |
| Windows  | `%HOME%\Documents\KiCad\9.0\scripting\plugins` |

<div class="note">

The type of plugin is determined by the Python class it inherits from.
Inheriting from `FootprintWizardBase.FootprintWizard` will create a
footprint wizard plugin, and inheriting from `pcbnew.ActionPlugin` will
create an action plugin. Creating action plugins and footprint wizards
is described in more detail below.

</div>

### `pcbnew` API overview

The scripting API reflects the internal object structure inside KiCad’s
Board Editor. It is provided by the `pcbnew` module in Python.

<div class="note">

Because the API is tightly coupled to KiCad’s internals, the API will
change over time and is not considered stable. Consult the [doxygen
documentation](https://docs.kicad.org/doxygen-python-nightly/namespaces.html)
for the most up-to-date API reference, and be sure to use the
documentation for the appropriate version of KiCad.

</div>

Scripts, action plugins, and interactive scripting sessions often start
with a call to `GetBoard()`, which returns a `BOARD` object representing
the currently open board and its contents.

`BOARD` has a set of properties and a set for each type of object in the
board: footprints, zones, tracks, vias, text, etc. Each type of object
has its own properties and holds its own objects: a footprint will
likely have at least one pad, for example.

The objects in the `BOARD` can be accessed using methods that each
return an iterable list of the corresponding object type. A selection of
these methods are listed below. Other methods are listed in the doxygen
documentation.

- `board.GetFootprints()`: returns a list of all of the footprints in
  the board.

- `board.GetDrawings()`: returns a list of miscellaneous board objects
  in the board.

- `board.GetTracks()`: returns a list of all of the tracks and vias in
  the board.

- `board.GetZones()`: returns a list of all of the zones in the board.

- `board.GetNetClasses():` returns a list of all net classes in the
  board’s design rules.

Boards can be loaded and saved from disk using the following functions:

- `LoadBoard(filename)`: loads a board from file, returning a `BOARD`
  object, using the file format that matches the filename extension.

- `SaveBoard(filename, board)`: saves a `BOARD` object to file, using
  the file format that matches the filename extension.

- `board.Save(filename)`: the same as `SaveBoard()`, but a method of the
  `BOARD` object.

#### Examples

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Load a board, hide all values, and show all references.**

</div>

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
from pcbnew import LoadBoard

filename = sys.argv[1]

pcb = LoadBoard(filename)
for fp in pcb.GetFootprints():
    print(f"* Footprint: {fp.GetReference()}")
    fp.Value().SetVisible(False)      # set Value as Hidden
    fp.Reference().SetVisible(True)   # set Reference as Visible

pcb.Save("mod_" + filename)

### Action plugins

Action plugin associate a script with a button in the PCB Editor GUI.
Clicking the button runs the script. Action plugins are shown in the
**Tools** → **External plugins** menu, and can also be shown in the
toolbar if enabled in the **Action Plugins** page of the **Preferences**
dialog.

The example below is an action plugin that uses KiCad’s `pcbnew` API to
replace the string `$date$` with the current date in any text item.

``` python
import pcbnew
import re
import datetime

class text_by_date(pcbnew.ActionPlugin):
    """
    test_by_date: A sample plugin as an example of ActionPlugin
    Add the date to any text field of the board containing '$date$'
    How to use:
    - Add a text on your board with the content '$date$'
    - Call the plugin
    - The text will automatically be updated with the date (format YYYY-MM-DD)
    """

    def defaults(self):
        """
        Method defaults must be redefined
        self.name should be the menu label to use
        self.category should be the category (not yet used)
        self.description should be a comprehensive description
          of the plugin
        """
        self.name = "Add date on PCB"
        self.category = "Modify PCB"
        self.description = "Automatically add date on an existing PCB"

    def Run(self):
        pcb = pcbnew.GetBoard()
        for item in pcb.GetDrawings():
            if item.GetClass() == "PCB_TEXT":
                txt = re.sub("\$date\$ [0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}",
                                 "$date$", item.GetText())
                if txt == "$date$":
                    item.SetText("$date$ %s" % datetime.date.today())


text_by_date().register()
```

### Footprint wizards

Footprint wizards are Python scripts that can be accessed from the
Footprint Editor. Each footprint wizard presents a selection of
parameters defined in the Python script, and creates a footprint based
on the parameter values.

There are 3 minimum steps required to create a footprint wizard, which
are described below. For examples of how to create footprint wizards,
see the footprint wizards included with KiCad.

1.  Instantiate a Python class, inheriting from
    `FootprintWizardBase.FootprintWizard`.

2.  Define the 6 required functions: `GetName()`, `GetDescription()`,
    `GetValue()`, `GenerateParameterList()`, `CheckParameters()`, and
    `BuildThisFootprint()`.

3.  Register the class by calling `{your_class_name}().register()`.

The `GetName()`, `GetDescription()`, and `GetValue()` functions are
there to provide strings to the UI. The only functionality needed is to
return an appropriate string.

The `GenerateParameterList()` function defines the parameters needed for
the footprint. Parameters are grouped into a `page` + `name` format. For
example, calling `self.AddParam("demo", "radius", self.uMM, 5)` would
add a parameter named radius into the page named demo. Retrieving that
parameter data would be done with a call such as
`self.footprint_radius = self.parameters["demo"]["radius"]`.

The `CheckParameters()` function is available to perform any data
validation on the parameters defined in `GenerateParameterList()`. This
function is also where the
`self.footprint_radius = self.parameters["demo"]["radius"]` calls
reside.

The `BuildThisFootprint()` function is where the footprint building
steps are called. This function is where one creates the footprint.

The required `{your_class_name}().register()` call can either be at the
end of the Python file, or in an `__init__.py` file. Both styles are
supported by KiCad.

<div class="note">

KiCad will not reload a plugin after it has raised an error (for
example, the `NotImplementedError`). One will need completely close out
KiCad and restart it. However, this doesn’t apply to changes which do
not raise an error.

</div>

## IDF component outlines

KiCad can [export an IDF representation of the board](#idf-exporter) for
use in mechanical CAD software. Below is some guidance on attaching IDF
component outlines to footprints, creating new IDF component outlines,
and a description of the IDF utilities included with KiCad.

### Specifying component models for use by the exporter

IDF component models are attached to footprints using the [footprint’s
3D model properties](#footprint-3d-models). The IDF exporter uses
different filetypes than the 3D viewer and other 3D model exporters, so
adding 3D models for the IDF exporter does not conflict with 3D models
added to a footprint for other purposes.

To add an IDF model to a footprint in the footprint or PCB editors, edit
the footprint’s properties and click on the 3D Models tab.

<figure>
<img src="images/footprint_3d_model_options.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="Footprint properties, 3D settings" />
</figure>

Click the ![folder icon](images/icons/small_folder_16.png) button and
select the **IDF (\*.idf;\*.IDF)** filetype filter. Browse to the
desired outline file.

<figure>
<img src="images/idf_select.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="IDF component outline selection" />
</figure>

Once the desired component outline file is selected, enter any necessary
values for the offset and rotation. The offsets must be specified using
the IDF board output units (mm or mils) and in the IDF coordinate
system, which is a right-hand coordinate system with +Z pointing towards
the viewer, +X to the viewer’s right, and +Y towards the upper edge of
the screen. The rotation must be in degrees; positive rotation is a
counter-clockwise rotation as described in the IDFv3 specification.

Multiple outlines may be combined with appropriate offsets to represent
simple assemblies such as a DIP package in a socket.

<div class="note">

Only the offset values and the Z rotation value are used by the IDF
exporter; all other values are ignored.

</div>

### Creating a component outline file

The component outline file (`*.idf`) consists of a single `.ELECTRICAL`
or `.MECHANICAL` section as described in the specification document. The
section may be preceded by any number of comment lines; the comment
lines are copied by the exporter into the library file and can be used
to track metadata such as references to the documents used to determine
the component’s outline and dimensions.

The component outline section contains fields which are strings,
integers, or floating point numbers. A string is a combination of
characters which may include spaces; if a string contains spaces then it
must be quoted. Quotation marks must not appear within a string.
Floating point numbers may be represented using decimal or exponential
notations but decimal notation is preferred for human readability. The
decimal point must be a dot and not a comma. The IDF file must consist
only of 7-bit ASCII characters; use of 8-bit characters will result in
undefined behavior.

An IDF file consists of SECTIONS which consist of RECORDS which consist
of FIELDS. For the IDF outline files only one type of section may exist
and must be one of `.ELECTRICAL` or `.MECHANICAL`. A record is a single
line of text and may contain one or more fields. Fields are sequences of
characters separated by one or more spaces which do not appear between
quotation marks. All fields of a record must appear on a single line;
records may not span lines.

The section heading (`.ELECTRICAL` or `.MECHANICAL`) is considered the
first record (Record 1) of the section. Record 1 must be followed by
Record 2 which has four fields:

1.  Geometry Name: a string which in combination with the Part Number
    must form a unique identifier for the component outline. For
    standardized packages, the package name is a good value for the
    geometry name, for example "SOT-23". For unique packages the
    manufacturer’s part number is a good choice for the geometry name.

2.  Part Number: although obviously intended for the part number, for
    example BS107, it is better to use this string to help describe the
    package. For example if the geometry name is "TO-92", the part
    number entry may be used to describe the layout of the pads or the
    orientation of this particular TO-92 outline file.

3.  IDF Unit: this must be one of `MM` or `THOU` and it applies only to
    the units describing this single component outline.

4.  Height: this is a floating point number representing the nominal
    height of the component using units specified in Field 3.

Record 2 must be followed by a number of Record 3 entries which specify
the outline of the component. Record 3 consists of four fields:

1.  Loop Index: `0` (outline points are specified in counter-clockwise
    order) or `1` (outline points are specified in clockwise order)

2.  X coordinate: a floating point number

3.  Y coordinate: a floating point number

4.  Included Angle: a floating point number. If the value is `0` then a
    straight line segment is drawn from the previous point to this
    point. If the value is `360` then the previous point specifies the
    center of a circle and this point specifies a point on the circle;
    never specify a circle using a value of `-360` as at least one major
    mechanical CAD package does not behave well in that situation. If
    the value is negative then a clockwise arc is drawn from the
    previous point to this point and if the value is positive then a
    counter-clockwise arc is drawn.

Only one closed loop is permitted and it is not possible to specify a
cutout. The last point specified must be the same as the first point
unless the outline is a circle.

Example IDF File 1:

    # a simple cylinder - this could represent an electrolytic capacitor
    .ELECTRICAL
        "cylinder" "5mm OD, 5mm height" MM 5
        0 0 0 0
        0 2.5 0 360
    .END_ELECTRICAL

Example IDF File 2:

    # an upside-down T
    # a comment added for the sake of adding comments
    .ELECTRICAL
        "Capital T" "5x8x10mm, upside down" MM 10
        0 -0.5 8 0
        0 -0.5 0.5 0
        0 -2.5 0.5 0
        0 -2.5 -0.5 180
        0 2.5 -0.5 0
        0 2.5 0.5 180
        0 0.5 0.5 0
        0 0.5 8 0
        0 -0.5 8 180
    .END_ELECTRICAL

### Guidelines for creating outlines

When creating outlines, and especially when sharing the work with
others, consistency in the design and naming of files helps people
locate files quicker and place the components with minimal hassles.

#### Package naming

Try to make some information about the outline available in the filename
to give the user a general idea of what the outline is. For example
axial leaded cylindrical packages may represent some types of capacitors
as well as some types of resistors, so it makes sense to identify an
outline as a horizontal or vertical axial leaded device and to add some
extra information on the relevant dimensions: diameter, length, and
pitch are the most important. If a device has a unique outline, the
manufacturer’s part number and a prefix to indicate the class of device
are adequate.

#### Comments

Use comments in the IDF file to give users more information about the
outline, for example a reference to the source used for dimensional
information.

#### Geometry and Part Number entries

Think carefully about the values to give to the Geometry and Part Number
entries. Taken together, these strings act as a unique identifier for
the MCAD system. The values of the strings will ideally have some
meaning to a user, but this is not necessary: the values are primarily
intended for the MCAD system to use as a unique ID. Ideally the values
chosen will be unique within any large collection of outlines; choosing
values well will result in fewer clashes especially in complex boards.

#### Pin orientation and positioning

Component outlines should be created to match the orientation and
position of the corresponding footprints. This avoids the need to
specify a non-zero rotation for the IDF component outline. Since the IDF
exporter ignores the (X, Y) offset values, it is vital that you use the
correct origin in the IDF component outline.

<figure>
<img src="images/idf_blobs.png" style="width:90.0%"
alt="Sample outlines" />
</figure>

The image above shows sample outlines generated by the programs `idfcyl`
and `idfrect` and rendered in a mechanical CAD program. From left to
right are (a) vertical radial leaded cylinder, (b) vertical axial leaded
cylinder with wire on left, (c) vertical axial leaded cylinder with wire
on right, (d) horizontal axial leaded cylinder, (e) horizontal radial
leaded cylinder, (f) square outline, plain, (g) square outline with
chamfer, (h) square outline with axial lead on right. The top outlines
were specified in units of millimeters while the bottom outlines were
specified in units of inches.

#### Tips on dimensions

The purpose served by the extruded outlines is to give the mechanical
designer some idea of the location and physical space occupied by each
component. In a typical scenario the mechanical designer will replace
some of the crude outlines with more detailed mechanical models, for
example when checking to ensure that a right-angle mounted LED will fit
into a hole on a panel. In most situations the accuracy of an outline
doesn’t matter, but it is good practice to create outlines which convey
the best mechanical information possible. In a few instances a user may
wish to fit the component into a case with very little excess space, for
example in a portable music player. In such a situation, if most
extruded outlines are a good enough representation of components then
the mechanical designer may only have to replace very few models while
designing the case. If the outlines are not a reliable reflection of
reality then the mechanical designer will waste a lot of time replacing
models to ensure a good fit. After all, if you put garbage in you can
expect garbage to come out. If you put in good information, you can be
confident of good results.

### IDF Component Outline Tools

A number of command-line tools are available to help generate IDF
component outlines. The tools are:

1.  `idfcyl:` creates an outline of a cylinder in vertical or horizontal
    orientation and with axial or radial leads

2.  `idfrect:` creates an outline of a rectangle which may have either
    an axial lead or a chamfer in the top left corner

3.  `dxf2idf:` converts a drawing in DXF format into an IDF component
    outline

#### idfcyl

`idfcyl` generates outlines for cylindrical components.

When `idfcyl` is invoked with no arguments it prints out a usage note
and a summary of its inputs:

    idfcyl: This program generates an outline for a cylindrical component.
        The cylinder may be horizontal or vertical.
        A horizontal cylinder may have wires at one or both ends.
        A vertical cylinder may have at most one wire which may be
        placed on the left or right side.

    Input:
        Unit: mm, in (millimeters or inches)
        Orientation: V (vertical)
        Lead type: X, R (axial, radial)
        Diameter of body
        Length of body
        Board offset
        *   Wire diameter
        *   Pitch
        **  Wire side: L, R (left, right)
        *** Lead length
        File name (must end in *.idf)

        NOTES:
            *   only required for horizontal orientation or
                vertical orientation with axial leads

            **  only required for vertical orientation with axial leads

            *** only required for horizontal orientation with radial leads

The notes can be suppressed by entering any arbitrary argument on the
command line. A user can manually enter information at the command line
or create scripts to generate outlines. The following script creates a
single cylinder axial leaded outline with the lead on the right hand
side:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate a cylindrical IDF outline for test purposes
# vertical 5mm cylinder,  nominal length 8mm + 3mm board offset,
# axial wire on right,  0.8mm wire dia., 3.5mm pitch

```

#### idfrect

`idfrect` generates outlines for rectangular components.

When `idfrect` is invoked with no arguments it prints out a usage note
and a summary of its inputs:

    idfrect: This program generates an outline for a rectangular component.
        The component may have a single lead (axial) or a chamfer on the
        upper left corner.
    Input:
        Unit: mm, in (millimeters or inches)
        Width:
        Length:
        Height:
        Chamfer: length of the 45 deg. chamfer
        *  Leaded: Y,N (lead is always to the right)
        ** Wire diameter
        ** Pitch
        File name (must end in *.idf)

        NOTES:
            *   only required if chamfer = 0

            **  only required for leaded components

The notes can be suppressed by entering any arbitrary argument on the
command line. A user can manually enter information at the command line
or create scripts to generate outlines. The following script creates a
chamfered rectangle and an axial leaded outline:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate various rectangular IDF outlines for test purposes
# 10x10, 1mm chamfer, 2mm height
idfrect - 1 > /dev/null <<  _EOF

```

#### dxf2idf

`dxf2idf` creates an IDF component file from a DXF outline.

The DXF file used to specify the component outline can be prepared with
the free software [LibreCAD](http://librecad.org/) for best
compatibility.

When `dxf2idf` is invoked with no arguments it prints out a usage note
and a summary of its inputs:

    dxf2idf: this program takes line, arc, and circle segments
        from a DXF file and creates an IDF component outline file.

    Input:
        DXF filename: the input file, must end in '.dxf'
        Units: mm, in (millimeters or inches)
        Geometry Name: string, as per IDF version 3.0 specification
        Part Name: as per IDF version 3.0 specification of Part Number
        Height: extruded height of the outline
        Comments: all non-empty lines are comments to be added to
            the IDF file. An empty line signifies the end of
            the comment block.
        File name: output filename, must end in '.idf'

The notes can be suppressed by entering any arbitrary argument on the
command line. A user can manually enter information at the command line
or create scripts to generate outlines. The following script creates a
5mm high outline from a DXF file `test.dxf`:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate an IDF outlines from a DXF file
dxf2idf - 1 > /dev/null << _EOF
test.dxf
mm
DXF TEST GEOMETRY
DXF TEST PART
5
This is an IDF test file produced from the outline 'test.dxf'
This is a second IDF comment to demonstrate multiple comments

test_dxf2idf.idf
_EOF
```

#### idf2vrml

The `idf2vrml` tool reads a set of one IDF Board (`.emn`) and one IDF
Component file (`.emp`) and produces a VRML file which can be viewed
with a VRML viewer. This feature is useful for visualization of the
board assembly in cases where the user does not have access to MCAD
software. Invoking `idf2vrml` without any arguments will result in the
display of a usage message:

    >./idf2vrml
    Usage: idf2vrml -f input_file.emn -s scale_factor {-k} {-d} {-z} {-m}
    flags:
       -k: produce KiCad-friendly VRML output; default is compact VRML
       -d: suppress substitution of default outlines
       -z: suppress rendering of zero-height outlines
       -m: print object mapping to stdout for debugging purposes
    example to produce a model for use by KiCad: idf2vrml -f input.emn -s 0.3937008 -k

<div class="note">

The `idf2vrml` tool does not correctly render `OTHER_OUTLINE` entities
in an `emn` file if that entity is specified on the back layer of the
PCB; however you will not noticeable using files exported by KiCad
because there is no mechanism to specify such an entity. This is only an
issue if you render a third party emn file which does employ an entity
on the back side of a board.

</div>
