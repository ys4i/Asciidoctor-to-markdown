# Simulator

KiCad provides an embedded electrical circuit simulator using
[ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net) as the simulation engine.
ngspice is a SPICE simulator derived from the original widely used
Berkeley SPICE program. KiCad’s simulator can also run simulations using
IBIS models of device pins.

The process of creating and running a simulation in KiCad has two main
parts:

1.  Drawing a simulation schematic in KiCad’s Schematic Editor.
    Schematics for simulations are similar to normal schematics (and can
    even be identical), but they typically include simulation-specific
    devices, such as sources, and may exclude devices that are
    irrelevant for simulation, such as connectors. Creating a schematic
    simulation requires ensuring all symbols in the schematic have
    appropriate models assigned. Finding or creating simulation models,
    and then validating them, can be a significant portion of the
    process. KiCad includes some simple simulation models for basic
    devices such as sources, passive devices, and generic semiconductor
    devices, but beyond those you will need to find or create your own
    models.

2.  Running the simulation using the simulator tool. This includes
    choosing the type of analysis (transient, AC, etc.) and configuring
    its options. Multiple different analyses can be performed. The
    simulator provides a plot window to view and analyze simulation
    results.

When drawing schematics for simulation, the `Simulation_SPICE` symbol
library, installed with KiCad by default, may be useful. It contains
common elements used for simulation such as voltage and current sources,
generic semiconductor symbols, and other simulation-specific devices.
The symbols in this library are described in detail
[below](#sim-default-library-symbols).

While these elements enable a great variety of simulation work, users
familiar with SPICE in other environments will be used to incorporating
models of commercially-available semiconductors, integrated circuits,
and other devices as more complex SPICE models. Indeed, semiconductor
manufacturers often freely supply these to help users simulate and
develop circuits using their parts. Note that while KiCad does not
include any commercial SPICE models in its distribution, you are free to
use any models you may have, or have used with other circuit simulators,
in KiCad’s simulator.

In general, if a model works with other SPICE simulators, it should work
with the KiCad simulator, although some SPICE simulators implement
extensions that are unsupported by ngspice. ngspice offers several
compatibility modes to improve compatibility with other simulators.

Finally, to quickly showcase the capabilities of the KiCad simulator,
some demonstration projects are included in the KiCad distribution. They
can be found in the `demos/simulation` directory.

## Assigning models

You need to assign simulation models to symbols before you can simulate
your circuit.

Each symbol can have only one model assigned, even if the symbol
consists of multiple units. For symbols with multiple units, you should
assign the model to the first unit.

SPICE model information is stored as text in symbol fields. Therefore
you may define it in either the symbol editor or the schematic editor.
To assign a simulation model to a symbol, open the Symbol Properties
dialog and click the **Simulation Model…​** button, which opens the
Simulation Model Editor dialog.

You can exclude a symbol from simulation entirely by checking the
**exclude from simulation** checkbox in the Symbol Properties dialog.
Symbols with this attribute set are drawn with a grey outline and a
small simulation icon next to them, as shown below.

<figure>
<img src="images/exclude_from_sim_symbol.png"
alt="exclude from sim symbol" />
</figure>

### Inferred models

Resistor, inductor, and capacitor models can be inferred, which means
that KiCad will detect that they are passives and automatically assign
an appropriate simulation model. Therefore they do not require any
special settings; users only need to set the `Value` field of the
symbol.

KiCad infers simulation models for symbols based on the following
criteria:

- The symbol has exactly two pins,

- The reference designator begins with `R`, `L` or `C`.

Inferred models are ideal models. If the simulation requires a non-ideal
model, for example an inductor with parasitic capacitance included, you
must explicitly assign a model that includes it.

### Built-in models

KiCad offers several standard simulation models. They do not require an
external model file, and their parameters can be edited in KiCad’s
Simulation Model Editor GUI. The following devices are available:

- Resistors (including potentiometers)

- Capacitors

- Inductors

- Transmission lines

- Switches

- Voltage and current sources

- Diodes

- Transistors (BJTs, MOSFETs, MESFETs, and JFETs)

- XSPICE code models

- Raw SPICE elements

To add a built-in model to a symbol, open the Simulation Model Editor
dialog (**Symbol Properties** → **Simulation Model…​**) and select
**Built-in SPICE model**. You can then select the kind of device from
the **device** dropdown and the device subtype from the **device type**
dropdown.

Refer to the [ngspice
documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html) for more
details about these models and their parameters.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_SME_builtin.png"
alt="Interface to set-up built-in models" />
</figure>

**Device** sets the type of device to simulate: a resistor, BJT, voltage
source, etc. This value is stored in the symbol’s `Sim.Device` field.

**Device type** selects the type of model to use for the device. Most
devices have several types of models to choose from. Models may vary in
their degree of accuracy, which characteristics they are optimized for,
what parameters they have available, and how many pins they have. For
example, the **ideal** resistor type models a simple resistor with two
terminals and a single `resistance` parameter, while the
**potentiometer** resistor type models an adjustable resistor with three
terminals and an additional parameter for wiper position. Some devices
have an especially large number of types to choose from: N-channel
MOSFETs, for example, have 17 available types, each of which uses a
different mathematical model to simulate the transistor behavior. One
model may be more or less appropriate than another for simulating a
specific device or circuit or for performing a particular analysis.
Refer to the [ngspice
documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html) for detailed
information about models and their parameters. The **device type** value
is stored in the symbol’s `Sim.Type` field.

The **parameters** tab displays the parameters of the model and lets you
edit them. For example, a resistor’s resistance, a voltage source’s
waveform, a MOSFET’s width and length, etc. Any parameters that differ
from the model’s defaults are stored in the symbol’s `Sim.Params` field.

The **code** tab displays the generated SPICE model as it will be
written to the SPICE netlist for simulation.

The **Save parameter '\<parameter name\>' in Value field** checkbox uses
the symbol’s `Value` field for storing parameters instead of the
`Sim.Params` field. This may make it easier to edit simple models from
the schematic, without opening the Simulation Model Editor. This option
is only available for ideal passive models (R, L, C) and DC sources. If
the field `Sim.Params` exists in the symbol, it will take priority over
the `Value` field.

### External models

KiCad can also load SPICE models from external files. This is typically
how you will add a SPICE model of a specific commercially-available part
(for example, a 555 timer or a TL071 operational amplifier) to your
simulation. Models such as these are readily available from numerous
sources, including manufacturers' web sites. These models must be in a
standard SPICE format and must not be encrypted.

An external model can be one of the following types:

- A device model (`.model`). This is an intrinsic device (a passive,
  diode, transistor, etc.) with a set of parameter values defining its
  behavior. The parameters for a device model are editable in the
  Simulation Model Editor GUI.

- A subcircuit model (`.subckt`). This is a model that uses a collection
  of other ngspice circuit elements to define its behavior. If a
  subcircuit model contains parameters (in a `params:` sequence in its
  definition), the parameters are editable in the Simulation Model
  Editor GUI.

To load a model from an external file, open the Simulation Model Editor
dialog (**Symbol Properties** → **Simulation Model…​**) and select
**SPICE model from file**.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_SME_from_file.png"
alt="Interface to set-up library models from file" />
</figure>

**File** is the path to the model file to use. Unencrypted model files
are plain, human-readable text files and often have extensions such as
`.lib`, `.sub` etc., although KiCad will accept a valid model with any
extension.

The path to the file can be absolute, or relative to the project folder.
The path can also be relative to the value of `SPICE_LIB_DIR` if you
have [defined that path
variable](../kicad/kicad.xml#kicad-environment-variables). If you enable
the **Embed File** checkbox in the file browser, the library file will
be [embedded](#sch-embedding-files) in the schematic (or symbol
library). This makes the schematic (or schematic) more portable as it
doesn’t rely on an external library file. The library filename is saved
in the symbol’s `Sim.Library` field.

**Model** is the name of the desired model in the model file. A model
file may contain multiple models, and if so they will all be shown in
the list. You can filter the list of models using the search box. The
selected model is listed in the symbol’s `Sim.Name` field.

Parameters can be overridden (or additional parameters specified) using
the **Parameters** tab. For device models, all parameters for that type
of device are editable. For subcircuit models, any parameters included
in the subcircuit definition are editable. Any parameters that are
overridden in the **Parameters** tab are stored in the symbol’s
`Sim.Params` field.

The **Code** tab displays the generated SPICE model as it will be
written to the SPICE netlist for simulation.

<div class="note">

KiCad is not distributed with SPICE models for specific commercial
devices. These models are usually available from device manufacturers or
other internet sources.

</div>

### IBIS models

IBIS (I/O Buffer Information Specification) files are an alternative to
SPICE models for modeling the behavior of input/output buffers on
digital parts. In order to load an IBIS file, users should follow the
procedure for SPICE library models, but provide a `.ibs` file.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_SME_ibis.png"
alt="Interface to set-up ibis models" />
</figure>

**File** is the path to the model file to use. The path can be absolute
or relative to the project folder. The path can also be relative to the
value of `SPICE_LIB_DIR` if you have [defined that path
variable](../kicad/kicad.xml#kicad-environment-variables). The library
filename is saved in the symbol’s `Sim.Library` field. If an IBIS model
file is loaded, the remaining fields in the dialog will relate to the
IBIS model.

**Component** selects which component from the IBIS file to use, as IBIS
files can contain multiple components. The component name is saved in
the symbol’s `Sim.Name` field.

**Pin** selects which pin in the IBIS model to simulate. The selected
pin must be mapped to a symbol pin in the **Pin Assignments** tab. The
chosen pin’s number is saved in the symbol’s `Sim.Ibis.Pin` field.

**Model** is the list of models available for the selected pin, for
example an input or an output. The chosen model name is saved in the
symbol’s `Sim.Ibis.Model` field.

**Type** selects what the pin should do in the simulation. A pin can be
a passive **device** that doesn’t drive any value; it can be a **DC
driver** that drives high, low, or high-impedance; or it can be a
**rectangular wave** or **PRBS driver**. This value is stored in the
symbol’s `Sim.Type` field.

The **Parameters** tab lets you see and edit the parameters of the
model. For each parameter, you can switch between a minimum, typical, or
maximum value, as defined in the IBIS file. You can also choose the
parameters of the driven waveform, depending on the pin’s chosen
**type**. Any parameters that differ from the defaults are stored in the
symbol’s `Sim.Params` field.

<div class="note">

KiCad does not ship with IBIS models for symbols. IBIS models are
usually available from device manufacturers.

</div>

<div class="note">

KiCad’s `Simulation_SPICE` symbol library provides several symbols that
may be useful for IBIS simulations. `IBIS_DEVICE` can be used for device
(input) pins, while `IBIS_DRIVER` can be used for simulating driver
pins. There are also variants of each for differential pins.

</div>

### Pin Assignment

Simulation models may have their pins numbered differently than the
corresponding symbol. For example, SPICE models for diodes usually
consider pin 1 to be the anode, while schematic symbols are usually
drawn with pin 1 as the cathode. Operational amplifier models are also
very likely to have model pin assignments that do not match package or
schematic pin numbers.

You can use the Simulation Model Editor’s **Pin Assignments** tab to map
the symbol’s pins to the simulation model pins.

<div class="note">

Always make sure symbol pins are correctly mapped to simulation model
pins. Mistakes here can lead to erroneous or confusing simulation
results, or a failure to simulate at all.

</div>

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_SME_pin.png" alt="Interface for pin assignment" />
</figure>

The left column displays the name and number of each symbol pin, i.e.
the pin numbers and names that appear on the schematic part in KiCad.
The right column displays the corresponding pin as defined in the model
file in use. For each symbol pin, you can select the corresponding pin
from the simulation model in the dropdown in the right column. In the
cases where a schematic part has pins that are not in the model, as in
the case of an operational amplifier with 'nulling' pins that are not
modeled, the schematic part pin may be assigned to the 'Not Connected'
option in the Pin Assignments dropdown. Unlike other pin assignments,
'Not Connected' may be assigned to multiple pins if necessary.

When you use a subcircuit model, the dialog displays the model’s code
under the pin assignments for use as a reference while assigning pins. A
well-written model will often include a helpful reference section (as a
set of comments) to inform the user how the model pins are mapped.

## Value notation

The simulator supports several notations for writing numerical values in
simulation model parameters, simulation analysis setup options, and
SPICE directives:

- Plain notation : `10100`, `0.003`,

- Scientific notation: `1.01e4`, `3e-3`,

- Prefix notation: `10.1k`, `3m`.

- RKM notation: `4k7`, `10R`.

You can mix prefix and scientific notations. As such, `3e-4k` is a valid
input and is equivalent to `0.3`. The list of valid prefixes is shown
below. They are case sensitive.

| Prefix | Name  | Multiplier       |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| a      | atto  | 10<sup>-18</sup> |
| f      | femto | 10<sup>-15</sup> |
| p      | pico  | 10<sup>-12</sup> |
| n      | nano  | 10<sup>-9</sup>  |
| u      | micro | 10<sup>-6</sup>  |
| m      | milli | 10<sup>-3</sup>  |
| k      | kilo  | 10<sup>3</sup>   |
| M      | mega  | 10<sup>6</sup>   |
| G      | giga  | 10<sup>9</sup>   |
| T      | tera  | 10<sup>12</sup>  |
| P      | peta  | 10<sup>15</sup>  |
| E      | exa   | 10<sup>15</sup>  |

<div class="note">

[Raw SPICE Element](#sim-builtin) models and
[directives](#sim-directives) are passed to ngspice directly, without
KiCad reformatting the values for ngspice to consume. ngspice uses a
different, case-insensitive notation: 1 mega (10<sup>6</sup>) is denoted
there as `1Meg`, while `1M` is 1 milli (10<sup>-3</sup>). Depending on
the compatibility mode selected, ngspice may not support the same value
notations as KiCad, so care should be taken when using raw SPICE
elements and simulation directives.

</div>

## SPICE directives

It is possible to add SPICE directives by placing them in text fields on
a schematic sheet. This approach is convenient for defining the default
simulation type. The list of supported directives in text fields is:

- Directives starting with a dot (e.g. `.tran 10n 1m`)

- Coupling coefficients for inductors (e.g. `K1 L1 L2 0.89`)

It is not possible to place additional components using text fields.

If a simulation command is included in schematic text, the simulator
will use it as the simulation command when you open the simulator.
However, you can override it in the Simulation Command dialog.

Refer to the [ngspice
documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html) for more
details about SPICE directives.

## Running simulations

Circuits for simulation are drawn in the Schematic Editor, but
simulations are run in the Simulator window.

After creating a schematic for simulation, the following steps are
needed to run a simulation:

1.  Open the Simulator window by clicking **Inspect** → **Simulator** in
    the Schematic Editor or using the ![simulator
    icon](images/icons/simulator_24.png) button in the top toolbar.

2.  Create at least one analysis by clicking **Simulation** → **New
    Analysis Tab…​** (<span class="keycombo">Ctrl+N</span>) or using the
    ![sim add plot 24](images/icons/sim_add_plot_24.png) button. This
    lets you choose a type of simulation and configure its options.
    These options are explained [below](#simulation-types). Each
    analysis has its own tab, and multiple analyses can be created. The
    options for an analysis can be adjusted after it is created with
    **Simulation** → **Edit Analysis Tab…​** or by clicking on the ![sim
    command 24](images/icons/sim_command_24.png) button.

3.  Run the simulation by clicking **Simulation** → **Run
    Simulation** (R) or by clicking the ![sim run
    24](images/icons/sim_run_24.png) button. This only runs the
    simulation in the active analysis tab. You can stop a running
    simulation at its current point by clicking the ![sim stop
    24](images/icons/sim_stop_24.png) button.

4.  Examine the [simulation results](#sim-results). Most analyses result
    in plots; for these you will need to select the signals to be
    plotted. Other analyses print their results in the output log
    window.

<div class="note">

Once a simulation has been set up, the configuration can be saved in a
[workbook](#sim-workbooks).

</div>

### Simulator window

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_main_dialog.png" alt="Main simulation dialog" />
</figure>

The simulator window is divided into several sections:

- The top of the window has a toolbar with buttons for commonly used
  actions.

- The main part of the window graphically shows the simulation results.
  The simulation needs to run and signals need to be selected from the
  list of available signals or probed before they are displayed in the
  plot.

- Below the plot panel, the output log window shows logs from the
  ngspice simulation engine. Some types of analyses print their results
  here.

- The right side of the window displays a list of signals, a list of
  active cursors, measurements, and a tuning tool for adjusting
  component values based on simulation results.

### Simulation types

Each simulation is a specific type of analysis. The following analysis
types are available:

- **OP** — DC Operating Point

- **DC** — DC Sweep Analysis

- **AC** — AC Small-signal Analysis

- **TRAN** — Transient Analysis

- **PZ** — Pole-zero Analysis

- **NOISE** — Noise Analysis

- **SP** — S-parameter Analysis

- **FFT** — Frequency-content Analysis

Each analysis type and its options are explained below. You can
configure an analysis when you create it (![sim add plot
24](images/icons/sim_add_plot_24.png) button) or by editing an existing
analysis (![sim command 24](images/icons/sim_command_24.png) button).
These analysis types are explained in more detail in the [ngspice
documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html).

<div class="note">

Another way to configure a simulation is to type [SPICE
directives](#sim-directives) into text fields on schematics. Any text
field directives related to a simulation command are overridden by the
settings selected in the dialog. This means that once a simulation has
run, the dialog overrides the schematic directives until the simulator
is reopened.

</div>

#### Operating point analysis (OP)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_op.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="OP analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the DC operating point of the circuit. This analysis has no
options.

Operating point analyses do not have any plotted results. Results are
printed in the output log window. You can also display the node voltages
and device currents calculated by this analysis as
[annotations](#sim-operating-point-annotations) in the schematic.

#### DC sweep analysis (DC)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_dc.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="DC analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the DC behavior of the circuit while sweeping one or two
parameters. The following parameters can be swept:

- value of an independent voltage source

- value of an independent current source

- value of a resistor

- simulation temperature

DC analyses have the following options, which are listed here with the
corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Sweep type**: the type of variable to sweep. This can be a voltage
  source, a current source, a resistor, or the simulation temperature.

- **Source**: the particular voltage source, current source, or resistor
  to sweep (`srcnam`). The list is populated with each item in the
  schematic of the relevant type. It is disabled for temperature sweeps.

- **Starting value**: the starting value for the sweep (`vstart`).

- **Final value**: the ending value for the sweep (`vstop`).

- **Increment step**: the amount to increase the value at each step of
  the sweep (`vincr`). Smaller increments result in more output points.

If **Source 2** is enabled, the same options are available to
simultaneously sweep a second source. Clicking the **Swap sources**
buttons swaps Source 1 with Source 2.

The output is displayed as a plot.

#### AC small-signal analysis (AC)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_ac.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="AC analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the small-signal AC behavior of the circuit in response to a
stimulus. Performs a decade sweep of stimulus frequency.

To run an AC analysis you must choose a number of points to measure per
decade and the start and end frequencies for the decade sweep.

AC analyses have the following options, which are listed here with the
corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Number of points per decade**: the number of points to calculate per
  decade (`nd`).

- **Start frequency**: the lower bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstart`).

- **Stop frequency**: the upper bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstop`).

The output is displayed as a Bode plot (output magnitude and phase vs.
frequency).

#### Transient analysis (TRAN)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_tran.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Transient analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the time-varying behavior of the circuit.

Transient analyses have the following options, which are listed here
with the corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Time step**: a suggested time step (`tstep`).

- **Final time**: the time at which the simulation will end (`tstop`).

- **Initial time**: the time at which the simulation will start
  (`tstart`). If not specified, this defaults to 0.

- **Max time step**: the maximum time step (`tmax`). If not specified,
  this defaults to the suggested time step or the total simulation
  duration divided by 50, whichever is smaller.

- **Use initial conditions**: if enabled, the simulator will not
  calculate the quiescent operating point before starting the transient
  simulation. Instead, the simulation will use the initial conditions
  specified in a `.ic` directive and element `IC` parameters. This
  corresponds to ngspice’s `uic` option.

The output is displayed as a plot.

#### Pole-zero analysis (PZ)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_pz.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Transient analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the poles and zeroes of the small-signal (AC) transfer
function of the circuit.

Pole-zero analyses have the following options, which are listed here
with the corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Transfer function**: selects between calculating the transfer
  function as output voltage divided by input voltage or output voltage
  divided by input current. These correspond to ngspice’s `vol` and
  `cur` options, respectively.

- **Input**: the input node (`node1`) and the reference node for the
  input (`node2`).

- **Output**: the output node (`node3`) and the reference node for the
  output (`node4`).

- **Find**: selects between calculating poles and zeroes, only poles, or
  only zeroes. These correspond to ngspice’s `pz`, `pol`, and `zer`
  options, respectively.

Operating point analyses do not have any plotted results. Results are
printed in the output log window.

#### Noise analysis (NOISE)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_noise.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="Noise analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the noise generated by the devices in the circuit, both as
output noise and input-referred noise. The noise spectrum (V/√Hz or
A/√Hz) of the circuit can be plotted, and the total noise over the
specified frequency range is reported. Optionally, the noise
contributions of each device are reported individually.

Noise analyses have the following options, which are listed here with
the corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Measured node**: the node at which output noise is measured
  (`output`).

- **Reference node**: the reference node for measuring the output noise
  (`ref`). The output noise is calculated as the noise at the measured
  node minus the noise at the reference node. If it is not specified,
  the default is the ground node.

- **Noise source**: a source that is considered the circuit’s input for
  the purposes of calculating input-referred noise (`src`). The source
  must specify an AC magnitude, i.e. the source must have an `ac`
  parameter.

- **Number of points per decade**: the number of points to calculate per
  decade (`pts`).

- **Start frequency**: the lower bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstart`).

- **Stop frequency**: the upper bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstop`).

- **Save contributions from all noise generators**: if enabled, noise
  magnitudes of individual noise generators are saved and reported. If
  disabled, only the overall output and input-referred noise over the
  specified frequency range are reported.

The output and input-referred noise spectra can be plotted. Total noise
values for the specified frequency range are printed in the output log
window.

#### S-parameter analysis (SP)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_sp.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="S-parameter analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates the scattering parameters, admittance matrix, and impedance
matrix for the circuit. Optionally calculates the noise current
correlation matrix. Note that this analysis requires at least two
voltage sources configured as RF ports as described in the ngspice
manual.

S-parameter analyses have the following options, which are listed here
with the corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Number of points per decade**: the number of points to calculate per
  decade (`nd`).

- **Start frequency**: the lower bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstart`).

- **Stop frequency**: the upper bound of the frequency range to analyze
  (`fstop`).

- **Compute noise current correlation matrix**: if enabled, the noise
  current correlation matrix is also calculated. This corresponds to
  ngspice’s `donoise` option.

The output is displayed as a plot.

#### Frequency content analysis (FFT)

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_analysis_fft.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="FFT analysis window" />
</figure>

Calculates an FFT based on an existing analysis tab. Any of the signals
from an existing analysis can be used as inputs to the FFT. The signals
are windowed using a Hanning window.

FFT analyses have the following options, which are listed here with the
corresponding ngspice parameter name:

- **Input signals**: the signal(s) to perform an FFT on. An FFT is
  independently applied to each selected signal.

- **Linearize inputs before performing FFT**: When enabled, the input
  vector is converted to have equidistant time points prior to
  performing the FFT. Corresponds to ngspice’s `linearize` command.

The output is displayed as a plot.

#### Additional simulation settings

There are several simulation options that apply to all types of
simulations. These are located at the bottom of the dialog.

- **Add full path for .include library directives**: if enabled,
  relative paths to SPICE models will be converted to absolute paths in
  the SPICE netlist.

- **Save all voltages**: if enabled, the simulator will save voltages
  for each node in the simulation results so that they can be plotted.
  This corresponds to ngspice’s `.save all` command in the SPICE
  netlist. If disabled, voltages will not be saved in the results, and
  therefore cannot be plotted, unless a SPICE directive is used to
  manually probe a node voltage.

- **Save all currents**: if enabled, the simulator will save currents
  through each device pin in the simulation results so that they can be
  plotted. This corresponds to ngspice’s `.probe alli` command in the
  SPICE netlist. If disabled, currents will not be saved in the results,
  and therefore cannot be plotted, unless a SPICE directive is used to
  manually probe a current.

- **Save all power dissipations**: if enabled, the simulator will save
  power dissipations for each device in the simulation results so that
  they can be plotted. This corresponds to ngspice’s
  `.probe P(<device>)` command in the SPICE netlist for each device in
  the schematic. If disabled, power dissipations will not be saved in
  the results, and therefore cannot be plotted, unless a SPICE directive
  is used to manually probe a power dissipation.

- **Save all digital event data**: if enabled, the simulator will save
  digital event data for digital (event-driven) simulation models. This
  corresponds to ngspice’s `.esave all` command. If disabled, digital
  event data will be discarded.

- The **Compatibility mode** dropdown selects the compatibility mode
  that the simulator uses to load models. The **User configuration**
  option refers to the user’s `.spiceinit` ngspice configuration file.
  Compatibility modes are described in the [ngspice
  documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html).

## Viewing simulation results

Each analysis has its own tab, containing its own separate plot, signal
list, and output log window. Only the active tab is updated when a
simulation is run. In this way it is possible to compare simulation
results between different runs.

Simulation results from most analysis types are visualized as
[plots](#sim-plotted-results). However, DC Operating Point (OP) and
Pole-zero (PZ) analyses do not generate plots. Instead, they [print
their results](#sim-numerical-results) in the output log at the bottom
of the simulator window. OP analysis results can additionally be
displayed as [annotations](#sim-operating-point-annotations) on the
schematic canvas.

### Plotted results

Most types of analyses display their results in a plot. The type of plot
depends on the analysis: transient simulations display signal values
over time, for example, while AC simulations display results in a Bode
plot.

You can zoom and move a plot using the following gestures:

- Scroll mouse wheel to zoom in/out. Shift, Ctrl, and Alt can modify the
  scroll action depending on the configuration in the Simulator panel in
  the Schematic Editor Preferences.

- Right click to open a context menu to adjust the view.

- Draw a selection rectangle to zoom in the selected area.

- Drag a cursor marker to move the cursor.

The list of signals that can be plotted in the active plot is shown in
the Signals pane on the right side of the simulator window. The
following types of signals can be plotted:

- Node voltages: the voltage of each net in the schematic, displayed as
  `V(<net>)`.

- Device node currents: the current for each device in the schematic,
  displayed as `I(<device>)` or `I(<device:terminal>)`. For two-terminal
  devices, the device’s current is listed as a single signal
  corresponding to the current into the device’s pin 1. For devices with
  more than two terminals, the current into each terminal is a separate
  signal.

- Device power dissipations: the power dissipated by each component,
  displayed as `P(<device>)`.

- [User-defined signals](#sim-user-defined-signals): custom signals
  defined as an expression based on other signals. User-defined signals
  can be arbitrary mathematical expressions. One common use for
  user-defined signals is to plot a voltage differential, i.e. the
  voltage between two points.

To plot a signal, check the box in the plot column next to the signal of
interest. To remove a signal from the plot, clear its checkbox.

You can also interactively select signals to plot by using the Probe
Schematic tool. To activate the tool, use **Simulation** → **Probe
Schematic…​** (P) or click the (![sim probe
24](images/icons/sim_probe_24.png)) button. When activated, the tool
lets you click elements in the schematic to plot the corresponding
signal. Different types of signals are probed depending on what you
click:

- Clicking on a wire plots the voltage of that net. When you hover over
  a wire, the net is highlighted to indicate that its voltage can be
  probed.

- Clicking on a symbol pin plots the current going into that pin. When
  you hover over a pin, the cursor changes to a current clamp to
  indicate that clicking will probe the current.

<div class="note">

KiCad does not support ngspice’s `.plot` directive. This directive has
no effect when a simulation is run using KiCad.

</div>

#### Plot settings and appearance

Colors of individual signals may be set by clicking the color field
associated with each signal in the Signals grid. You may choose from a
predefined palette (**Defined Colors**), or select a custom color
(**Color Picker**). You can toggle the color of the plot background from
black to white with **View** → **Dark Mode Plots** (this affects all
analysis tabs, not just the active tab).

Many plot settings can be configured in the **Plot Setup** tab of the
Analysis Setup window (![sim command
24](images/icons/sim_command_24.png) button).

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_plot_setup.png" alt="sim plot setup" />
</figure>

- **Fixed scale**: when enabled, this fixes the vertical and/or
  horizontal plot scales to the specified ranges. Manually zooming will
  not affect an axis if its scale is fixed.

- **Show grid**: when enabled, a grid will be shown behind the plotted
  signals. You can also turn the grid on or off with **View** → **Show
  Grid**.

- **Show legend**: when enabled, a legend will be shown on the plot for
  the enabled signals. You can reposition the legend by dragging it.

- **Dotted current/phase**: when enabled, plotted signals representing
  current (transient simulations) or phase (AC simulations) are
  displayed using dotted lines instead of solid lines. You can also
  enable this setting with **View** → **Dotted Current/Phase**.

- **Margins**: this controls the padding on each side of the plot.

#### Cursors

For precise measurement, cursors are available in the plot window. You
can add a cursor to a signal by checking the **Cursor 1** or **Cursor
2** checkbox for the signal in the signal grid on the right.

Once cursors have been added, the horizontal position of each cursor is
shown by a number in a triangular marker at the top of the plot display.
You can reposition each cursor by clicking and dragging its marker. The
vertical position of each cursor tracks its assigned signal. The
horizontal and vertical value for each cursor are shown in the cursor
grid on the right of the simulator window. If cursors 1 and 2 are both
enabled, the difference between them is also shown.

To precisely position a cursor, you can directly edit its horizontal
position in the cursors grid. You can also modify the display format
(unit range and number of significant digits) by right clicking a value
in the cursors grid and clicking **Format** for the relevant quantity.

You can also add more cursors beyond the two default cursors. To create
more cursors, right click on a signal in the signals grid and click
**Create new cursor**. To remove an extra cursor, right click in a one
of the extra cursor columns and click **Delete cursor 3** (or whichever
cursor you want to delete).

#### Measurements

You can add automatically calculated measurements for any plotted
signal, such as a minimum, average, or peak-to-peak measurement.

<div class="note">

Measurements are made over all the data resulting from the simulation,
not just the data that is visible in the plot window at the current zoom
setting.

</div>

<div class="note">

It is not necessary to have selected a signal for plotting (by selecting
its Plot checkbox) in order to make a measurement on it. Even unplotted
signals can be measured.

</div>

To add a predefined measurement to a signal, right click on a signal in
the signals grid and select a measurement. The following measurements
are available:

- **Measure Min**: measures the minimum value of the entire signal

- **Measure Max**: measures the minimum value of the entire signal

- **Measure RMS**: measures the root-mean-square value of the entire
  signal

- **Measure Peak-to-peak**: measures the peak-to-peak value of the
  entire signal

- **Measure Time of Min**: measures the time at which the minimum value
  of the entire signal occurs

- **Measure Time of Max**: measures the time at which the maximum value
  of the entire signal occurs

- **Measure Integral**: computes the time integral value of the entire
  signal

- **Perform Fourier Analysis**: performs a Fourier analysis of the
  selected signal based on a specified fundamental frequency. Calculates
  the amplitude of the harmonics of the fundamental as well as the total
  harmonic distortion. This measurement is only available for transient
  analyses, and its results are printed in the simulation log window
  instead of in the measurement panel.

Measurement results are displayed in the Measurement pane at the lower
right of the Simulator window. Multiple measurements will display as
multiple rows in this area. You can delete a measurement by right
clicking it and clicking **Delete Measurement**. To modify the display
format of a measurement result (unit range and number of significant
digits), right click the value and click **Format Value…​**.

The above context menu options are a shortcut for directly specifying
measurements in the the Measurement pane. To manually create a new
measurement, click in an empty row in the Measurement pane and type in
an ngspice measurement function. You can also edit existing measurements
by clicking on them. For more information about measurements and their
syntax, refer to the ngspice manual.

### Numerical results

While most analyses display their results as plots, DC Operating Point
(OP) and Pole-zero (PZ) analyses do not result in plots. Instead, these
analyses print their results as text in the simulation log window.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_pz_results.png" alt="sim pz results" />
</figure>

#### Operating point annotations

For the OP analysis, annotations can also be added to the schematic
indicating the operating point voltage and current values at the nodes.
Operating point voltage annotations can be shown or hidden for every
node with **View** → **Show OP Voltages**. Operating point current
annotations can be shown or hidden for every symbol pin with **View** →
**Show OP Currents**. These annotations are globally shown or hidden for
every node or every pin. You can control the formatting of these
annotations in the [Formatting panel of Schematic
Setup](#schematic-setup-formatting).

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_op_voltages.png" alt="sim op voltages" />
</figure>

You can also display operating point results using text variables. Using
text variables requires more work to set up but provides more control
over how the data is displayed. For example, you can use text variables
to display only certain voltages or currents, or to control the display
formatting of particular values. You can also use text variables to
display power dissipation measurements.

To use text variables to display an operating point voltage for a net,
add a [label](#labels) to the net, then add a field to that label. The
label can contain any text as long as it contains the `${OP}` text
variable. The text variable can contain formatting specifiers in the
form `${OP.<precision><unit>}`, but both the precision and unit are
optional. Precision is the number of significant digits to display,
which is 3 by default. Unit is the unit to use, including a prefix, such
as `mV` for millivolts.

As an example, a label field containing the text `Vout: ${OP}`, attached
to a net with an operating point voltage of 5.123V, displays as "Vout:
5.12V". The text `${OP.4mV}` displays as "5123mV", `${OP.2}` displays as
"5.1V", and `${OP.mV}` displays as "512mV".

Using text variables to display an operating point current into a device
pin is similar, but uses symbol fields instead of label fields. The
field can contain any text as long as it contains the `${OP:<pin>}` text
variable. The pin can be specified as a pin name or a pin number. For
two-terminal devices, the pin can be omitted, and the current into the
device’s pin 1 will be reported. The same optional formatting specifiers
are supported as for voltages, in the form
`${OP:<pin>.<precision><unit>}`.

For example, in a symbol with an operating point current of 5.123mA
through pin 1 (pin name `C`), a symbol field containing the text
`Ic: ${OP:C}` displays as "Ic: 5.12mA". The text `${OP:C.2mA}` displays
as "5.1mA", `${OP:1.4}` displays as "5.123mA", and `${OP:C.A}` displays
as "0.00512A".

You can also use text variables to display a device’s power dissipation.
This works identically to current, but with `power` instead of a pin
name or number. For example, in a symbol with an operating point power
dissipation of 5.123mW, a symbol field containing `${OP:power.2mW}`
displays as "5.1mW".

<div class="note">

Don’t forget to set the label field or symbol field to visible, or it
will not be displayed.

</div>

### User-defined signals

In addition to the list of signals that come from the nets in the
schematic, you can define your own signals which behave like normal
signals in most respects. User defined signals are defined as
mathematical operations on one or more basic signals.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_user_defined_signals.png"
alt="sim user defined signals" />
</figure>

To add a user-defined signal, open the User-defined Signal dialog with
**Simulation** → **User-defined Signals…​** (![sim add signal
24](images/icons/sim_add_signal_24.png) button) and add a signal. The
new signal will appear in the Signal grid, where it can be plotted and
used like any other signal. User-defined signals are also included in OP
results.

<div class="note">

Unlike normal signals, which are plotted incrementally as a simulation
progresses, user-defined signals are not plotted until the simulation
completes.

</div>

One use for user-defined signals is to plot a differential voltage, i.e.
the voltage between two arbitrary nodes. For example, to plot the
voltage difference between the nets `/v1` and `/v2`, you can create a
user-defined signal with the expression `/v1-/v2` and then plot it. This
expression could also be written in a number of different ways, for
example `V(/v1)-V(/v2)` or `V(/v1,/v2)`, which are both equivalent.

A number of mathematical functions are available for use in user-defined
signals. To see a list, click the **Syntax help** link in the
User-defined Signals dialog. Refer to the ngspice manual for details on
each of these functions.

<div class="note">

Net names may contain special characters that have particular meaning to
the ngspice interpreter. In particular, ngspice interprets the dash
character (`-`) as a subtraction operation. To ensure that net names are
interpreted correctly, surround the net name with double quote (`"`)
characters when referring to it in a user-defined signal.

</div>

## Tuning components

It is possible to adjust the value of basic components in the schematic
from within the simulation interface, which lets you conveniently adjust
component values based on simulation results. Each time the component
value is tuned, the simulation is re-run with the new component value.
You can tune the value of passive resistors, inductors, and capacitors,
or the voltage or current of DC voltage and current sources.

<div class="note">

You can only tune components when running analyses that result in a
plot. In other words, you cannot tune components when running an
operating point analysis.

</div>

To tune a component, use **Simulation** → **Add Tuned Value…​**, the
keyboard shortcut T, or the ![tune icon](images/icons/sim_tune_24.png)
button in the toolbar, and then click on the component to tune in the
schematic. This adds a tuning control for that component in the bottom
right corner of the simulator window. Multiple components can be tuned
at once, with a separate tuning control per component.

<figure>
<img src="images/sim_tuner.png" alt="sim tuner" />
</figure>

- The top text field sets the top end of the tuning range.

- The bottom text field sets the bottom end of the tuning range.

- The middle text field sets the actual component value that is used in
  the simulation. This value can also be adjusted using the slider.

- The **Save** button updates the schematic symbol with the tuned value.
  Until you press the **Save** button, the schematic symbol will keep
  its original value.

- The ![trash icon](images/icons/small_trash_16.png) button removes the
  component from the Tune panel and restores its original value.

In addition, it is possible to restrict the component values to those
from a particular series of Preferred Values — either of the E24, E48,
E96 or E192 series. This is particularly useful when it is necessary to
restrict component values to commercially available parts.

## Saving simulation setups

You can save a simulation setup in a workbook. Workbooks are files that
store information about a simulation setup, including which analyses are
configured and what their settings are, which signals are plotted for
each analysis, user-defined signals, measurements, cursors, and display
settings. A workbook can be saved and reloaded later to restore the
previously configured settings in a new session. Workbooks can include
more than one simulation: for example, it may contain separate tabs for
transient, operating point, and AC analyses which you added as you
worked.

You can save a workbook using **File** → **Save Workbook** and load one
using **File** → **Open Workbook**. The most recently used workbook is
automatically loaded when the simulator is opened.

<div class="note">

Workbooks store simulation setup information, but they do not store
simulation results. You can export simulation results to PNG (graphics)
or CSV (simulation data values) with **File** → **Export Current Plot as
PNG…​** and **File** → **Export Current Plot as CSV…​**. To recreate the
results of simulations stored in a workbook, select the appropriate
analysis tab in the Simulator window and run the simulation again (R or
**Simulation** → **Run Simulation**).

</div>

## Exporting simulation results

KiCad’s simulator offers two ways to export results:

- as a PNG (Portable Network Graphics format) image of a simulation data
  plot,

- as a plain text file of simulation data values, in CSV
  (Comma-Separated Value) format.

Only simulations that produce plots (see above) can be exported as an
image or a CSV file. The results of OP and PZ analyses cannot be
exported in this way.

### Exporting results as graphics

The currently-visible Simulator plot may be exported as a PNG file using
the command **File** → **Export Current Plot as PNG…​**.

The size and aspect-ratio of the saved image will match that of the
displayed plot in the Simulator.

You can also copy an image of the active plot to the clipboard using
**File** → **Export Current Plot to Clipboard**, or insert an image of
the active plot into the schematic using **File** → **Export Current
Plot to Schematic**. Exporting a plot to the schematic is equivalent to
exporting the plot to the clipboard and then pasting it into the
schematic.

### Exporting results as numerical data

The currently-visible Simulator plot may be exported as a CSV file using
the command **File** → **Export Current Plot as CSV…​**.

The data in the simulation plot is exported as multiple columns. The
precise format is dependent upon the analysis type. In general, there
will be multiple columns of data, one corresponding to each variable
selected for plotting. The first row of the file is a header row,
containing the name of the variable in the column (i.e. 'time',
'V(/Vout)1' or similar).

<div class="note">

When exporting to CSV, only variables selected using their Plot checkbox
will be included in the exported file.

</div>

<div class="note">

The data in the exported file contains all the data that would be
plotted if the entire plot were displayed. If the plot is zoomed in to
show a particular region this will still be the case, resulting in the
output file containing more data than the user might expect.

</div>

<div class="note">

This function exports the data with data separated by semicolons (`;`)
rather than commas. Programs reading this data may need to be configured
to expect a semicolon as a delimiter.

</div>

## Troubleshooting simulations

Sometimes a simulation will fail, either with or without errors being
reported. Paying attention to the error messages reported, taking care
in the development and entry into KiCad of the circuit to be simulated,
and making use of the KiCad, ngspice and general SPICE documentation and
information from fellow users in forums is very worthwhile and can often
point the way to a solution.

It’s worth noting, for users unfamiliar with SPICE, ngspice or circuit
simulation in general that some 'common' and interesting circuits can
sometimes be tricky to simulate accurately or reliably. These include
apparently simple circuits such as oscillators, which in some cases may
fail to oscillate at all! It is nearly always possible to build a
working simulation but sometimes this can more require SPICE experience
than might be initially apparent, or the guidance of someone who already
has it. The ngspice documentation, once again, is worth reading for
insights into good and effective simulation practices if you are
encountering difficulty.

### Incorrect netlist

It is possible to inspect the SPICE netlist with **Simulation** → **Show
SPICE netlist…​** (![netlist 24](images/icons/netlist_24.png) button).
This method of troubleshooting requires some SPICE knowledge, but
spotting errors in the netlist can help determine the cause of
simulation problems, as well as providing confirmation of what input
ngspice is actually acting on.

### Simulation error messages

The output console displays messages from the simulator. It is advisable
to check the console output to verify there are no errors or warnings.
Messages appearing in the console may be conveniently selected, copied,
and pasted if you wish to share them.

A common error message is "timestep too small". This message means that
the simulation engine is unable to calculate the next point in the
simulation, even when using the minimum possible time increment. This
error can have many causes, including numerical convergence issues with
a simulation model used in the circuit or with the circuit itself. It
can also be caused by mistakes in drawing the circuit, such as
incorrectly [assigning pins to the simulation
model](#simulation-pin-assignment) or forgetting to provide a voltage
supply.

### Convergence problems

In case the simulation does not converge in a reasonable amount of time
(or not at all), it is possible to add the following SPICE directives.
More information is available in the ngspice manual.

<div class="warning">

Changing convergence options can lead to erroneous results. These
options should be used with caution.

</div>

    .options gmin=1e-10
    .options abstol=1e-10
    .options reltol=0.003
    .options cshunt=1e-15

- `gmin` is the minimum conductance allowed by the program. The default
  value is `1e-12` (1 pS).

- `abstol` is the absolute current error tolerance of the program. The
  default value is `1e-12` (1 pA).

- `reltol` is the relative error tolerance of the program. The default
  value is `0.001` (0.1%).

- `cshunt` adds a capacitor of the specified value from each voltage
  node in the circuit to ground.

### Simulation pin assignments

If unexpected results are generated by a simulation despite it running
without obvious errors, it is worth double-checking that the
[assignments between the pins of the part instance in the KiCad
schematic and that of the associated model](#simulation-pin-assignment)
are correct. These have to be correct for each instance of the model in
the schematic.

## Helpful hints

Some helpful tips, hints and advice to help you get the most from using
ngspice in KiCad for simulation.

### The ngspice manual is your friend!

Fundamentally the KiCad Simulator is a user-friendly front-end to the
powerful ngspice circuit simulator. Therefore problems with the details
of simulation, the correct use of SPICE elements, models, etc. is beyond
the scope of the KiCad documentation but is very likely to be fully and
completely addressed in the ngspice documentation itself. It’s therefore
recommended not to overlook this [valuable
resource](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs.html).

<div class="note">

KiCad updates may result in changes to the ngspice version used by the
simulator. The current version of ngspice used in a particular version
of KiCad is shown on the **Help** → **About KiCad** dialog, under the
**Version** tab. Referring to the online ngspice documentation will
ensure you always have access to the latest information for reference.

</div>

### Organizing third-party models

Although it is certainly possible to keep simulation models (i.e.
`.lib`, `.sub` files) in the directories associated with individual
KiCad projects, this will likely result in unnecessary copies of model
files proliferating as you create simulations. Consider creating a
dedicated storage location (directory, folder) for models, perhaps
organized by manufacturer or device type, to hold these files. Then they
may simply be referenced in simulations at a common location.

### Simulation symbols and models in KiCad’s libraries

The KiCad libraries provide a number of symbols for simulation in the
`Simulation_SPICE` symbol library. Most of these symbols have SPICE
models already assigned as appropriate, although you may need to adjust
the model parameters in order to obtain the desired simulation behavior.

The `Simulation_SPICE` symbol library contains the following symbols:

|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Symbol Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 0                | A ground (node 0) symbol. Note that a standard GND symbol from another library can also be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| BSOURCE          | A symbol for a SPICE B-source (nonlinear dependent voltage or current source). Refer to the [ngspice manual](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs/ngspice-html-manual/manual.xhtml#sec_Non_linear_Dependent_Sources) for information on B-sources.                                                                                |
| D                | A diode symbol. Note that the pin assignment is appropriate for both simulation and PCB layout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ESOURCE          | A symbol for a SPICE E-source (linear voltage-controlled voltage source). By default it is set up with a gain of 1 V/V. Refer to the [ngspice manual](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs/ngspice-html-manual/manual.xhtml#subsec_Exxxx__Linear_Voltage_Controlled) for more information on E-sources.                           |
| GSOURCE          | A symbol for a SPICE G-source (linear voltage-controlled current source). By default it is set up with a gain of 1 A/V.

Most of these symbols in the `Simulation_SPICE` library use [built-in
models](#sim-built-in), but several symbols use [external
models](#sim-library) from the `Simulation_SPICE.sp` simulation model
library. The simulation model library is a separate file in the same
folder as the symbol library. This simulation model library also
contains SPICE models that may be useful for use with other symbols.

The `Simulation_SPICE.sp` simulation model library contains the
following models:

These parameters can be edited in the Parameters grid of the SPICE Model Editor dialog.                                                                                                                          |
| kicad_builtin_vdiff      | A differential voltmeter model. The voltage difference between the first two terminals is output as a ground-referenced voltage on the third terminal. This model is used by the VOLTMETER_DIFF symbol in the `Simulation_SPICE` symbol library.                                                                                                                                                                       |
