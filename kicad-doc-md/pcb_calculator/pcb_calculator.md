# Introduction

The KiCad PCB Calculator is a set of utilities to help you find the
values of components or other parameters of a layout. The Calculator has
the following tools:

- Regulators

- Track Width

- Electrical Spacing

- Trans Line

- RF Attenuators

- Color Code

- Board Classes

# Calculators

## Regulators

This calculator helps with the task of finding the values of the
resistors needed for linear and low-dropout voltage regulators.

For the *Standard Type*, the output voltage Vout as a function of the
reference voltage Vref and resistors R1 and R2 is given by:

alt="Regulators" />
</figure>

For the *3 terminal type*, there is a correction factor due to the
quiescent current Iadj flowing from the adjust pin:

alt="Regulators" />
</figure>

This current is typically below 100 uA and can be neglected with
caution.

To use this calculator, enter the parameters of the regulator *Type*,
*Vref* and, if needed, *Iadj*, select the field you want to calculate
(one of the resistors or the output voltage) and enter the other two
values.

## RF-Attenuators

With the RF Attenuator utility you can calculate the values of the
resistors needed for different types of attenuators:

- PI

- Tee

- Bridged Tee

- Resistive Splitter

To use this tool, first select the type of attenuator you need, then
enter the desired attenuation (in dB) and input/output impedances (in
Ohms).

## E-Series

This calculator helps to identify combinations of standard E-series
resistors that meet a required resistance, optionally excluding several
resistor values that are not available.

## Color-Code

This calculator helps translating the color bars from the resistor to
its value. To use it, first select the *tolerance* of the resistor: 10%,
5% or equal or smaller than 2%. For example:

- Yellow Violet Red Gold: 4 7 x100 ±5% = 4700 Ohm, 5% tolerance

- 1kOhm, 1% tolerance: Brown Black Black Brown Brown

## TransLine

Transmission line theory is a cornerstone in the teaching of RF and
microwave engineering.

In the calculator you can choose different sorts of Line Types and their
special parameters. The models implemented are frequency-dependent, so
they disagree with simpler models at high *enough* frequencies.

This calculator is heavilly based on
[Transcalc](http://transcalc.sourceforge.net/).

models are listed below:

## Via Size

The Via Size tool calculates the electrical and thermal properties of a
given plated through-hole pad or via.

</figure>

## Track Width

The Track Width tool calculates the trace width for printed circuit
board conductors for a given current and temperature rise. It uses
formulas from IPC-2221 (formerly IPC-D-275).

</figure>

## Electrical Spacing

This table helps finding the minimum clearance between conductors.

Each line of the table has a minimum recomended distance between
conductors for a given voltage (DC or AC peaks) range. If you need the
values for voltages higher than 500V, enter the value in the box in the
left corner and press *Update Values*.

## Board-Classes

### Performance Classes

In IPC-6011 have been three performance classes established

- **Class 1 General Electronic Products**: Includes consumer products,
  some computer and computer peripherals suitable for applications where
  cosmetic imperfections are not important and the major requirement is
  function of the completed printed board.

- **Class 2 Dedicated Service Electronic Products**: Includes
  communications equipment, sophisticated business machines, instruments
  where high performance and extended life is required and for which
  uninterrupted service is desired but not critical. Certain cosmetic
  imperfections are allowed.

- **Class 3 High Reliability Electronic Products**: Includes the
  equipment and products where continued performance or performance on
  demand is critical. Equipment downtime cannot be tolerated and must
  function when required suchas in life support items or flight control
  systems. Printed boards in this class are suitable for applications
  where high levels of assurance are required and service is essential.

### PCB Types

In IPC-6012B there are also 6 Types of PCB defined:

- Printed Boards without plated through holes (1)

  - 1 Single-Sided Board

- And Boards with plated through holes (2-6)

  - 2 Double-Sided Board

  - 3 Multilayer board without blind or buried vias

  - 4 Multilayer board with blind and/or buried vias

  - 5 Multilayer metal core board without blind orburied vias

  - 6 Multilayer metal core board with blind and/orburied vias
