# Publishing KiCad Addons

This document is a guide for users and plugin developers who are
interested in creating addon packages that can be installed by the KiCad
plugin and content manager.

## The Plugin and Content Manager

The plugin and content manager (PCM) allows KiCad users to discover and
install addon packages from public or private repositories. These addon
packages may contain Python plugins, symbol or footprint libraries,
color themes, and other KiCad content.

The KiCad team operates an official repository of addon content that is
available by default to KiCad users. Users may also add other
repositories, either hosted publicly by third parties or privately (for
example, an internal corporate repository).

## Packaging your content

A KiCad addon package consists of a compressed archive file containing a
metadata file, the package content, and several optional files. The
archive must be in ZIP format (compatible with the ISO 21320-1
standard). The contents of the archive file depend on the package type,
but all packages must include a control file called `metadata.json` that
is described in detail below.

<div class="note">

Addon archives must follow the exact folder structure listed below.
Extra files that are not related to your addon are not permitted and
must be stripped out of the archive.

</div>

### Python plugins

The structure of a Python plugin archive must look like:

    Archive root
    |- plugins
       |- __init__.py
       |- ...
    |- resources
       |- icon.png
    |- metadata.json

`icon.png` is an optional 64x64-pixel icon that will be displayed
alongside your package in the PCM dialog. If no icon is supplied, the
`resources` subdirectory may be empty or omitted.

The contents of the `plugins` subdirectory should include any Python
source files and resources required by your plugin. Place your plugin
directly inside the `plugins` subdirectory, not inside a second level of
subdirectory.

<div class="note">

For action plugins that supply a toolbar button icon, this icon should
be smaller (24x24) and located inside the `plugins` subdirectory. The
action plugin toolbar icon will not be used by the PCM.

</div>

### Content libraries

The structure of a content library package must look like:

    Archive root
    |- footprints
       |- first-library.pretty
          |- my-footprint.kicad_mod
          |- ...
       |- second-library.pretty
          |- another-footprint.kicad_mod
          |- ...
    |- 3dmodels
       |- 3d-library.3dshapes
          |- my-model.stp
          |- my-model.wrl
          |- ...
    |- symbols
          |- my-symbols.kicad_sym
          |- ...
    |- resources
       |- icon.png
    |- metadata.json

Each content library package must contain one or more of the
`footprints`, `3dmodels`, or `symbols` subdirectories. Each of these
subdirectories may contain one or more libraries of the corresponding
type.

`icon.png` is an optional 64x64-pixel icon that will be displayed
alongside your package in the PCM dialog. If no icon is supplied, the
`resources` subdirectory may be empty or omitted.

### Color themes

The structure of a color theme package must look like:

    Archive root
    |- colors
       |- my-theme.json
    |- resources
       |- icon.png
    |- metadata.json

`icon.png` is an optional 64x64-pixel icon that will be displayed
alongside your package in the PCM dialog. If no icon is supplied, the
`resources` subdirectory may be empty or omitted. For color themes, it
is best if the icon somehow represents the theme, for example by using
the same primary colors and background color as the theme.

### Metadata file format

The metadata file, `metadata.json`, follows a JSON schema, currently
published at <https://go.kicad.org/pcm/schemas/v1>

Unless otherwise noted all fields are limited to valid UTF-8 code points
and 1000 characters.

Example `metadata.json` for a color theme:

    {
        "$schema": "https://go.kicad.org/pcm/schemas/v1",
        "name": "My Beautiful Theme",
        "description": "A theme that makes KiCad truly beautiful",
        "description_full": "I came up with this theme in a dream one night.",
        "identifier": "com.github.kicad-user.kicad-beautiful-theme",
        "type": "colortheme",
        "author": {
            "name": "KiCad User",
            "contact": {
                "web": "https://mywebsite.com"
            }
        },
        "maintainer": {
            "name": "KiCad User",
            "contact": {
                "web": "https://mywebsite.com"
            }
        },
        "license": "CC0-1.0",
        "resources": {
            "homepage": "https://github.com/kicad-user/kicad-beautiful-theme"
        },
        "versions": [
            {
                "version": "1.0",
                "status": "stable",
                "kicad_version": "5.99",
                "download_sha256": "YOUR_SHA256_HERE",
                "download_size": 1234,
                "download_url": "https://github.com/YOUR/DOWNLOAD/URL/kicad-beautiful-theme.zip",
                "install_size": 5678
            }
        ]
    }

#### Fields

`$schema`: **(optional)** Must contain the URL to the current KiCad
package JSON schema (<https://go.kicad.org/pcm/schemas/v1>)

`name`: **(required)** The human-readable name of the package (may
contain any valid UTF-8 characters)

`description`: **(required)** A short free-form description of the
package that will be shown in the PCM alongside the package name. May
contain a maximum of 150 characters.

`description_full`: **(required)** A long free-form description of the
package that will be shown in the PCM when the package is selected by
the user. May include line breaks.

`identifier`: **(required)** The unique identifier for the package. May
contain only alphanumeric characters and the dash (`-`) symbol. Must be
between 2 and 50 characters in length. Must start with a latin character
and end with a latin character or a numeral. See instructions below on
namespaces for guidelines for selecting an identifier.

`type`: **(required)** The type of the package; one of `plugin`,
`library`, or `colortheme`.

`author`: **(required)** Object containing one mandatory field, `name`,
containing the name of the package creator. An optional `contact` field
may be present, containing free-form fields with contact information.

`maintainer`: **(optional)** Semantics same as `author`, but containing
information about the maintainer of the package. Can be omitted if same
as author.

`license`: **(required)** A string containing the license under which
the package is distributed.

The license must be a valid string under [Debian license
rules](https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/#license-specification)
with the following modifications:

- The MIT license is always taken to mean the [Expat
  license](https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/mit).

- The Creative Commons licenses are permitted without a version number,
  indicating the author did not specify which version applies.

- Stripping of trailing zeroes is not recognized.

- `CERN-OHL` is recognized as a valid license.

- `WTFPL` is recognized as a valid license.

- `Unlicense` is recognized as a valid license.

The following license strings are also valid and indicate other
licensing not described above:

- `open-source`: Other Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license.

- `unrestricted`: Not an OSI approved license, but not restricted.

`resources`: **(optional)** Additional resource links for the package.
Place your website, github, documentation and other links here.

`keep_on_update`: **(optional)** **(since KiCad 7.0)** List of regular
expressions describing which files should be kept on package update.
Each file from the extracted package is tested against all regex with
the `$KICADX_3RD_PARTY` component removed. If it matches any expression
then it will not be deleted.

If your plugin type package archive has `keepme.txt` file directly in
`plugins` directory, then path `/plugins/your_package_id/keepme.txt`
will be tested against all regex in the list.

<div class="note">

- For consistency, directory delimiter will always be forward slash
  (`/`) even on windows. Tested path will have a leading forward slash.

- Dots in package identifier are replaced with underscore (`_`) when
  extracted.

- When updating the package `keep_on_update` field is used as it is in
  the repository at the moment of update, not at the moment of previous
  version installation.

- [Extended
  POSIX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX-Extended_Regular_Expressions)
  flavour of regular expressions is used.

</div>

<div class="tip">

If you want to keep all ini and bkp files on update, this regex will
work: `.*(\.ini|\.bkp)$`.

If you want to keep all .step files from 3d models directory:
`^/3dmodels/.*\.step$`

</div>

`versions`: **(required)** A list of objects describing package
versions. Each version object can contain the following keys:

`version`: **(required)** A string containing the version of the package
(format of this is up to you).

`status`: **(required)** A string containing one of the following:

- `stable`: This package is stable for general use.

- `testing`: This package is in a testing phase, users should be
  cautious and report issues.

- `development`: This package is in a development phase and should not
  be expected to work fully.

- `deprecated`: This package is no longer maintained.

`kicad_version`: **(required)** The minimum required KiCad version for
this package (major.minor).

`kicad_version_max`: **(optional)** The latest KiCad version this
package is compatible with (major.minor).

`download_sha256`: **(optional)** A string containing a SHA-256 hash of
the package archive.

`download_url`: **(optional)** A string containing a direct download URL
for the package archive.

`download_size`: **(optional)** The size of the package archive, in
bytes.

`install_size`: **(optional)** The size of the package (uncompressed),
in bytes.

`keep_on_update`: **(optional)** **(since KiCad 7.0)** Same semantics as
corresponding field in package struct but specific to this version.
Field of the package version user is updating **to** is used, not the
package user is updating **from**.

`runtime`: **(optional)** **(since KiCad 9.0.1)** For plugin packages,
this field may be set to either "ipc" or "swig" to indicate which
runtime the plugin requires. If not set, the plugin will be assumed to
require the SWIG (legacy) runtime.

<div class="note">

The `download_*` keys must only be present in the version of the
`metadata.json` that you submit to the package metadata repository, not
in the version of the file that is actually present in the package
archive. It is not possible to put a valid `download_sha256` value in
the `metadata.json` file inside the archive.

</div>

## Submission to the official repository

KiCad hosts an official addons repository that is available by default
to all KiCad users. To be included in the official repository, your
package must meet several requirements beyond the technical requirements
described above.

### Namespacing and naming

- Your package identifier **must** be namespaced using reverse-DNS
  format. For example, official KiCad addons use the namespace
  `org.kicad.packagename`.

- If your addon content is hosted on a publicly-visible code-hosting
  service such as GitHub or GitLab, your namespace should be based on
  this service. For example, `com.github.username.packagename`. The
  package identifier should generally match the repository name if there
  is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the package and the repository.

- Your package namespace may also be based on a domain name that you
  control. If there is no obvious link between the domain name you
  submit and the download location of your package, or if it is not
  otherwise clear that you control the domain name, the KiCad team may
  request further information before approving your submission.

- Your package identifier **must** be unique. The namespacing
  requirements above should make this easy.

- If you are not clearly a maintainer of the project, we must have
  written confirmation from a maintainer that you are permitted to
  submit the project to the KiCad repository on their behalf.

- Your package must not be a fork or copy of an existing package in the
  KiCad repository, unless your fork is significantly different in scope
  from the original work and has a clearly unique name, or unless you
  are proposing to replace an abandoned project (see below).

### Licensing

- Packages **must** be licensed under a valid open-source license.
  Closed-source packages may be used with KiCad under a third-party
  repository, but all packages in the official KiCad repository must be
  open-source to allow for code review, issue reporting, and to maintain
  license compatibility with KiCad itself.

- Packages containing code (Python plugins) **must** be licensed under
  an open-source license [compatible with the GNU
  GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses).

- Packages containing data (color themes, libraries, etc) should be
  licensed under a Creative Commons or similar license.

### Technical requirements

- Metadata files submitted to the official repository **must** include
  the `download_sha256` key in the metadata, containing a valid SHA-256
  hash of the archive file.

- The `download_url` **must** point to a publicly-accessible URL.

- Package metadata **must** be in English. Package contents (for
  example, the language used inside a dialog created by a Python plugin)
  may be in any language, but the package description should clearly
  state if the contents are in a language other than English. At this
  time, KiCad does not have a built-in mechanism to allow for plugins to
  offer multiple language translations.

- The package source **must** be hosted in a location that allows issue
  reporting and tracking. Examples that meet this requirement include
  GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and Sourceforge.

### Content policy

- Packages added to the official KiCad addon repository **must** follow
  our community [Code of
  Conduct](https://www.kicad.org/contribute/code-of-conduct/). The KiCad
  team reserves the right to review package content and metadata and
  reject submissions that violate this code of conduct.

- The KiCad team makes no guarantees about the quality, security, or
  safety of any addon content, but will strive to maintain a general
  standard of security and safety. If a security, safety, or privacy
  issue related to a package is brought to our attention, we reserve the
  right to take corrective actions up to and including removing a
  package from the repository without advance notice. In this case, the
  package can be submitted to the repository again once the issue has
  been resolved to the satisfaction of the KiCad team.

- The KiCad team reserves the right to modify or expand on this policy
  in the future in order to best meet the needs of the KiCad user
  community. Publishers of existing packages that become in violation of
  new or updated content policies will receive advance notice and have
  the opportunity to make changes to meet the updated policies.

### Abandoned content policy

- The KiCad team may consider a package published to the official
  repository abandoned if we are unable to contact the maintainer, or if
  it has bugs preventing its use on a stable version of KiCad that
  remain open with no feedback for longer than 90 days. In order to
  prevent the situation of users installing broken packages from the
  official repository, the KiCad team may edit (for example, by changing
  the `kicad_version_max` field) or remove packages from the repository
  if they have been abandoned.

- Anyone wishing to "revive" an abandoned project can do so either by
  taking over maintenance of it from the original submitter (with their
  permission) or by forking it and submitting it under a new name. The
  standard requirements for all packages will apply to the newly-forked
  project.

### Commercial Services

- Packages that link to or provide commercial services, including but
  not limited to PCB fabrication, component lookup and order management,
  **must** first contact the KiCad team at <plugins@kicad.org> to
  discuss commercial plugin options.

#### Commercial Service FAQ

We need to have a simple contract on file with the commercial service
provider. This protects both the KiCad project and the commercial
service provider.

In general, we will only deal with the service provider. They may be
interested in contracting with you to build a plugin or in allowing
third-party plugins generally. Either way, we need to discuss this
directly with the service provider.

We are not lawyers. We pay lawyers to review our contracts and make sure
that the KiCad project and, by extension, our users are legally safe. We
do not have the resources to review other entities' terms of service or
to watch them for changes. This is one reason why we need a direct
contract with the commercial service provider.

No. We place no restrictions on users publishing and publicising their
own plugins. Open Source does not require us to distribute or publish
others' content.

No. As long as your plugin doesn’t connect to the commercial service
provider, we do not need a contract with the provider.

Yes! We love it when we can make the process of PCB creation easier for
our users. Please e-mail the KiCad team at <plugins@kicad.org> and we’ll
help to make this happen.

## Submitting your package

Once you have created a package following the guidelines above, and
confirmed that your package is available for download using the URL
listed in the metadata file, you can submit your package to the official
KiCad addon repository.

To do so, you must have an account at GitLab, and submit your metadata
file as a merge request to the Package Metadata repository at
<https://gitlab.com/kicad/addons/metadata>. Create a directory inside
the packages directory named the same as your package identifier, and
containing the `metadata.json` file and any additional optional metadata
files (for example, an icon) as described above. You may submit more
than one new package in a single merge request as long as the packages
share a namespace.

<div class="note">

Do not submit merge requests to the public-facing repository at
<https://gitlab.com/kicad/addons/repository> - changes to this
repository are made automatically based on changes to the metadata
repository.

</div>

## Updating your package

Updates should be submitted as additional merge requests that change the
`metadata.json` file (and any other package files that need updating).
You may submit updates to more than one package in a single merge
request as long as the packages share a namespace.
