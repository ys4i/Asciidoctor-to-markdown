# Introduction to the KiCad PCB Editor

The KiCad PCB Editor is a PCB layout application distributed as a part
of KiCad and available for the following operating systems:

- Linux

- Apple macOS

- Windows

Regardless of the OS, all KiCad files are 100% compatible from one OS to
another.

The PCB Editor is an integrated application where all functions of
placing footprints, routing tracks, library management, and data
transfer to and from the schematic capture software are carried out
within the editor itself.

The KiCad PCB Editor is intended to communicate directly with the KiCad
Schematic Editor for designing printed circuit boards from schematics
without using any intermediate files. It can also import netlist files,
which list all the electrical connections, from other packages.

The PCB Editor includes a footprint library editor, which can create and
edit footprints and manage libraries. It also integrates the following
additional but essential functions needed for modern PCB design
software:

- Design rules check (DRC) for automatic detection of design rule
  violations such as incorrect and missing connections, copper clearance
  and minimum width violations, and many other design issues

- Scriptable design rules for specifying rules with complex constraints
  and conditions

- An interactive router with multiple modes of operation
  (push-and-shove, walkaround, highlight collisions) and support for
  differential pair routing as well as length and skew tuning

- Export of fabrication and plot files in many formats (Gerber,
  IPC-2581, ODB++, GenCAD, PDF, PostScript, and SVG)

- A 3D viewer and 3D model generation in many formats (STEP, GLB, BREP,
  XAO, PLY, STL, IDF, and VRML)

## Initial configuration

When the PCB Editor is run for the first time, if the global footprint
table file `fp-lib-table` is not found in the KiCad configuration folder
then the KiCad will ask how to create this file:

<figure>
<img src="images/en/fp_lib_table_initial_setup.png"
alt="footprint library table initial setup dialog" />
</figure>

The first option is recommended (**Copy default global footprint library
table (recommended)**). The default footprint library table includes all
of the standard footprint libraries that are installed as part of KiCad.

If this option is disabled, KiCad was unable to find the default global
footprint library table. This probably means you did not install the
standard footprint libraries with KiCad, or they are not installed where
KiCad expects to find them. On some systems the KiCad libraries are
installed as a separate package.

- If you have installed the standard KiCad footprint libraries and want
  to use them, but the first option is disabled, select the second
  option and browse to the `fp-lib-table` file in the directory where
  the KiCad libraries were installed.

- If you already have a custom footprint library table that you would
  like to use, select the second option and browse to your
  `fp-lib-table` file.

- If you want to construct a new footprint library table from scratch,
  select the third option.

Footprint library management, including how to re-run this initial
configuration, is described in more detail
[later](#managing-footprint-libraries).

## The PCB Editor user interface

The main PCB Editor user interface is shown above, with some key
elements indicated:

1.  Top toolbars (file management, zoom tools, editing tools)

2.  Left toolbar (display options)

3.  Message panel and status bar

4.  Right toolbar (drawing and design tools)

5.  Appearance panel

6.  Selection filter panel

## Navigating the editing canvas

The editing canvas is a view onto the board being designed. You can pan
and zoom to different areas of the board, and also flip the view to show
the board from the bottom.

By default, dragging with the middle or right mouse button will pan the
canvas view and scrolling the mouse wheel will zoom the view in or out.
You can change this behavior in the Mouse and Touchpad section of the
preferences (see [Configuration and
Customization](#configuration-and-customization) for details).

Several other zoom tools are available in the top toolbar:

- ![Zoom In icon](images/icons/zoom_in_24.png) zooms in on the center of
  the viewport.

- ![Zoom Out icon](images/icons/zoom_out_24.png) zooms out from the
  center of the viewport.

- ![Zoom to Page icon](images/icons/zoom_fit_in_page_24.png) zooms to
  fit the frame around the drawing sheet.

- ![Zoom to Objects icon](images/icons/zoom_fit_to_objects_24.png) zooms
  to fit the items within the drawing sheet.

- ![Zoom to Selection icon](images/icons/zoom_area_24.png) allows you to
  draw a box to determine the zoomed area.

The cursor’s current position is displayed at the bottom of the window
(X and Y), along with the current zoom factor (Z), the cursor’s relative
position (dx, dy, and dist), the grid setting, and the display units.

The relative coordinates can be reset to zero by pressing Space. This is
useful for measuring distance between two points or aligning objects.

## Hotkeys

The <span class="keycombo">Ctrl+F1</span> shortcut displays the current
hotkey list. The default hotkey list is included in the [Actions
Reference](#pcbnew-actions-reference) section of the manual.

The hotkeys described in this manual use the key labels that appear on a
standard PC keyboard. On an Apple keyboard layout, use the Cmd key in
place of Ctrl, and the Option key in place of Alt.

Many actions do not have hotkeys assigned by default, but hotkeys can be
assigned or redefined using the hotkey editor (**Preferences** →
**Preferences…​** → **[Hotkeys](#preferences-controls)**).

<div class="note">

Many of the actions available through hotkeys are also available in
context menus. To access the context menu, right-click in the editing
canvas. Different actions will be available depending on what is
selected or what tool is active.

</div>

Hotkeys are stored in the file `user.hotkeys` in KiCad’s configuration
directory. The location is platform-specific:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\kicad\9.0\user.hotkeys`

- Linux: `~/.config/kicad/9.0/user.hotkeys`

- macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/kicad/9.0/user.hotkeys`

KiCad can import hotkey settings from a `user.hotkeys` file using the
**Import Hotkeys** button in the hotkey editor.
